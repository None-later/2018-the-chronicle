 Nonsikelelo Moyo, Chronicle Reporter TWO Harare men who stole cellphones from revellers during last yearâ€™s iFlix Victoria Falls Carnival, have each been sentenced to 21 months in jail. Tatenda Katemanyengo, George Makuvire and Takudzwa Mawire also of Harare who is at large, were found in possession of an IPhone and two Samsung smart phones stolen during the carnival. Mawire who defaulted after the trio was granted bail in January, has since been issued with a warrant of arrest. Katemanyengo and Makuvire will, however, serve an effective 17 months in jail after four months of their sentence was suspended on condition of good behaviour. They were also ordered to pay $50 compensation for the property they damaged at the Victoria Falls lodge where they were booked. The phones were discovered in a torn mattress in their room at the lodge. Katemanyengo and Makuvire pleaded not guilty to theft of the cellphones and malicious damage to property before Ms Lindiwe Maphosa. They were, however, convicted of theft and malicious damage to property due to overwhelming evidence against them. @nonsy
