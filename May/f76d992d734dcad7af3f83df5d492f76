 Cape Town — Siya Kolisi will lead the Springboks against England in the forthcoming three-Test series, while Pieter Steph-du Toit has been entrusted with the captaincy for Saturday’s historic Test in Washington against Wales. Rassie Erasmus, the SA Rugby director of rugby, confirmed the two appointments yesterday morning at a media conference at the team hotel in Johannesburg. Erasmus, who took over the coaching reins of the Springboks after his appointment in April, also confirmed the Springboks’ 26-man travelling squad for the Welsh encounter in Washington. The squad members not involved in the Welsh match will stay behind in Johannesburg to continue with their preparations for the coming international season. Erasmus congratulated Kolisi and Du Toit on their respective appointments. Both men will captain the Springboks for the first time. “It’s a huge honour to captain the Springboks and Siya and Pieter-Steph are two honest, hardworking men who enjoy the respect of their fellow players,” said Erasmus. “I believe both of them will do a good job as captains. My philosophy is that each player must take responsibility for his position and must therefore work extremely hard with that one goal in mind — to make the Springboks successful again,” added Erasmus. — Sport24
