SKIES Las Palmas Academy won the Harvest in Sports Under-16 soccer tournament held in Harare at the weekend. The team beat eight other academies including Bhekimpilo Nyoni’s BN Academy which they beat 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in regulation time. The project was headed by Trevor Mazhande, an FA and Uefa B qualified coach, who has vast experience working in junior football within the United Kingdom and is attached to English Premiership side West Bromwich Albion as their Under-15 coach. Skies Las Palmas co-founder Gremah Ndebele said his boys gained a lot of experience. “We were ambassadors of Bulawayo soccer and the players’ performance proved we’re on the right track. “The boys played entertaining football led by 14-year-old Mduduzi Mwene from Milton High School,” said Ndebele. He appealed to the Bulawayo community to support the talent as the boys have shown hunger for success. En route to the final, Skies Las Palmas beat BN Academy 1-0, drew 1-1 with Glenview Academy, beat Red Cross 2-1 and then thumped Real Saints 3-0. Ndebele said although there were no scholarship promises, the experience and exposure to a different environment and competitive football was good for the youngsters. — @DecoDecent2
