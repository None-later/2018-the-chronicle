 Showbiz Correspondent FANS will be able to vote for their favourite artiste, as the National Art Merit Awards (NAMAs) organisers National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) have launched the People’s Choice Award WhatsApp platform. The NAMA voting platform was launched on Monday and will close on the awards night, February 17 at 8PM. The awards will be held at the Reps Theatre in Harare. To vote for one’s favourite artiste for this year’s People’s Choice Award, one has to send the artist’s name to this WhatsApp number +263 772 168 045. The syntax is #ARTIST NAME. The artiste with the most votes will be declared a winner and awarded at the awards ceremony. NACZ’s deputy director Nicholas Moyo said the popularity vote was for artistes and institutions from the eight disciplines. “The public is at liberty to select an artiste of their choice in any of the NAMA categories of Music, Literary Arts, Dance, Visual Arts, Film and Television, Theatre and Spoken Word,” said Moyo. “The People’s Choice Award is a special award given to an artist or arts organisation selected by the public. The public is afforded the opportunity to vote for an artist of their own choice at every NAMA.” Apart from being broadcast live on ZBCtv, the ceremony will for the first time be streamed on Facebook Live. “The 17th NAMA shall be televised on ZTV and many arts lovers and followers can make a date for the live coverage. The ceremony shall also be streamed live on more than 30 Facebook pages already linked to the official NAMA NACZ Facebook page,” said Moyo. The planned live streaming on Facebook of the NAMAs comes after the announcement of the nominees last week live through the NAMA NACZ Facebook page. Although there was a power outage that disrupted the live stream, it was completed later on in the day. For the past two years Zimdancehall chanter Winky D has won the People’s Choice Award.
