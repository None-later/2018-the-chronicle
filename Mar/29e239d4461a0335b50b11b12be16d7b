 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Matabeleland South Province Darts Association has appealed to the corporate world to assist its provincial teams financially as they prepare for the national competitions later this month. Mashonaland Central will host this year’s national darts competitions that are set to begin on March 28.  Each province is allowed to field two men and two ladies’ teams. Matabeleland South Province Association chairperson Gine Ngwenya said they risked not sending a team for the nationals if they do not get financial assistance. “We have so many clubs in the province, but the hindrance to the growth of the sport in the region is the lack of sponsorship for these clubs to reach their full potential. We are registered with the National Darts Association of Zimbabwe (Ndaz).
