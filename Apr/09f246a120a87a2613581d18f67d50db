Great Zimbabwe University students based at Mashava campus demonstrate over fees increase on Thursday Walter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent GREAT Zimbabwe University students based at Mashava campus went on a rampage destroying property and looting food in the dining hall over allegations of “arbitrary” fee increases by authorities. The students on Thursday fought running battles with anti-riot police who threw teargas to quell the protest. Some vehicles that were parked near the university, including the university clinic and one of the directors’ houses were damaged. GZU director of information, Mr Anderson Chipatiso, confirmed the student’s demonstration but said peace had been restored. “I can confirm our students are demonstrating. We are still assessing the cause of the demonstration. So far the situation is peaceful and we are working on it and in a few minutes, there will be a resolution,” said Mr Chipatiso. Students who spoke to The Chronicle on condition of anonymity said the demo, which started around 8AM, was mainly triggered by the increase of semester fees from $650 to $700. They alleged that they were not consulted before the fee increase and also complained about poor food quality, poor internet connectivity and inadequate buses to transport them to and fro their learning centres. “We woke up to find fees had increased. The authorities increased our fees by $50 up to $700 from $650. There are only two buses for us yet we are more than 3 000. We want more buses to ferry us to and fro the learning centre. The food is also of poor quality and we expect the authorities to address that,” said a student. Mashava Campus is home to the Faculty of Arts and Faculty of Commerce. — @walterbmswazie3
