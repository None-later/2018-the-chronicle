Prince Dube Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter CLUBLESS striker Prince Dube has returned to his boyhood club Highlanders and could feature in this weekend’s encounter against Ngezi Platinum Stars at Barbourfields Stadium. It has since emerged that the 2016 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League Rookie of the Year is now a free agent after being released by SuperSport United of South Africa and could be eligible to play in the local Premiership despite the second transfer window closing on July 31. Fifa statutes state that a player can be registered anytime as long as he was a free agent before the closure of the transfer window. “Yes, the boy is back home after we reached a mutual agreement with SuperSport United to terminate his contract, which happened before the closure of the Zimbabwean transfer window. At the moment, we are in talks with Highlanders with a view to having them take him back, but of course, that will depend on whether or not they have a slot in their books,” said Gibson Mahachi, who represents Dube. Highlanders added three new players to their squad during the second transfer window and might be forced to lay off one player to accommodate their prodigal son. Clubs in the local PSL are allowed to register 30 players of which five must be Under-19. Nicknamed Mgadaffi, Dube was a revelation at the Bulawayo giants and his talents caught the attention of national team selectors, who drafted him into the Warriors’ squad that won the 2017 Cosafa Cup in South Africa. His last game for the Bosso was on June 18, 2017, during which he scored the third goal in their 3-0 thrashing of Hwange.
