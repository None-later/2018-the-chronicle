Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE inaugural edition of the Old Mutual Nkulumane Half Marathon was hit by a tragedy on Sunday following the death of a veteran long distance runner, Leonard Kazembe, a few hours after the race. Kazembe (69), is said to have collapsed 20 minutes after crossing the finishing line of the main race and was ferried to hospital by an ambulance where he later died. He will be buried at his rural home in Rusape. Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) chairperson Manuel Mpofu said Kazembe’s death was a great loss to the athletics’ fraternity as he was one of the permanent features in Bulawayo athletics events. “Kazembe was a Grandmaster. He completed the race on Sunday as number 78 overall and third in his category. Everyone involved in the organisation of the Old Mutual Nkulumane Half Marathon would like to express our sincere condolences to Kazembe’s family and friends. The news of his passing came as a shock to everyone. I had an opportunity to chat with him just before the race and it was really sad to hear of his passing after the race,” said Mpofu. Kazembe successfully ran the gruelling PPC Matopos 33-Miler in March before Sunday’s tragic run.
