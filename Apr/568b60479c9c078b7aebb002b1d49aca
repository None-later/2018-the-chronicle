Dr Qhubani Moyo Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent THE Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) has registered more than 30 000 people under the continuous voter registration programme. The continuous voter registration programme followed the mobile biometric voter registration BVR (blitz) and voter registration mop up exercise which saw over 5,3 million people registering to vote. It ended on February 8. In a statement, Zec said 32 615 people have registered to vote at its 63 static centres dotted across the country following the end of the BVR exercise. “Following the end of the blitz, continuous voter registration is taking place at the 10 Zec provincial and 63 district offices. Total voters registered to date at the continuous voter registration centres after the blitz is 32 615 as at April 3,” read Zec’s statement. The electoral body said citizens classified as aliens are still facing challenges registering as voters as they do not have adequate documentation. A total of 249 people have been turned away from registration under the continuous registration programme. “Following the court order to register persons formerly classified as ‘Aliens’, the issue of long birth certificates still poses challenges for some of the ‘Aliens’,” it said. Zec commissioner Dr Qhubani Moyo said the electoral body is satisfied with the number of people who have registered to vote so far. He said the figure confirms that voter registration is an ongoing process. “Voter registration is continuous in terms of the law. People can still register for this election until 12 days after the Nomination Court seats. We’re seeing a positive sign by Zimbabweans that people are still registering to vote even after the closure of mobile voter registration,” said Dr Moyo. Zec has promised to deliver a credible, free and fair election. — @nqotshili
