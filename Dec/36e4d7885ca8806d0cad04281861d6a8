The Chronicle Response to “Fuel-hoarding mechanic burnt, dies”: More like karma, pathetic! – Objective Mind Response to “Govt speaks on doctors’ demands”. Government needs to adopt the Cuban way of doing things. Had those doctors done national service like their Cuban counterparts, we wouldn’t be hearing them crying about US dollars. Well, they seem to have been promised jobs somewhere; they must just resign en mass peacefully. —Ralph Mbegu Mutombwa Response to “Sexual harassment at workplaces is one of the most rampant forms of abuse that has gone unreported, studies have shown”. Wake up guys, use your phones to take photos and make recordings for later use as evidence. Please report all this to the police. – Charles Rwamozorah Response to “Zanu-PF’s commitment to devolution commendable”. Avoid party politics when it comes to government policies because the government is there to serve every citizen regardless of political grouping and affiliation. Local government should serve the people -Zimbabwe interests first. – Gakangoma77 Response to “Zanu-PF, MDC-A to share $8m”. I wish there were a provision in the Political Parties (Finance) Act that allows only responsible parties to benefit from that money. .- Tafara Shumba
