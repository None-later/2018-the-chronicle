Vice President Chiwenga EDITOR — Vice President Constantino Chiwenga’s remarks in Harare South and Epworth assuring residents of protection from land barons are welcome.  Thousands of people have been duped by land barons pretending to have housing solutions when they are preying on desperate home seekers for a profit. It was about time someone read the riot act and called people to order, thank you VP Chiwenga. I was also encouraged by indications that basic amenities and services are being prioritised by the Government in these areas. Harare South and Epworth have long been ticking health time bombs. Promises of lasting solutions on water, sanitation and sewer reticulation are very much relevant to the cause of thousands who were sold sub-serviced land by unscrupulous dealers. It shows that the Government is caring unlike in the past where ministers and legislators were involved in some of these dodgy deals. We look forward to the arrest of those who prejudiced people of their hard earned money and as a Harare South resident, I am glad he singled out Shadreck Mashayamombe, I believe he has a case to answer before the courts of law. Urban development has to be orderly and sustainable, I thank VP Chiwenga for taking a leading role in this cause. T Tembo, Stoneridge.
