MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has hit out at SuperSport football analysts, who he says have a campaign against him not to be named as the Absa Premiership Coach of the Year. Masandawana were held to a 2-2 draw by an impressive Maritzburg United side at the Harry Gwala Stadium on Wednesday evening. Speaking after the game Mosimane nominated counterpart Fadlu Davids as this season’s coach of the year, while at the same time hitting out at his own critics.  “Fadlu is a very, very good coach,” Mosimane said. “He’s my candidate to win the coach of the year, not the cheerleaders in your (SuperSport 4) studio, who are unbelievable and are punting against me.”  —  Sports24.co.za.
