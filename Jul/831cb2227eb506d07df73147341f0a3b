Cde Owen Ncube Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief THE Cotton Company of Zimbabwe (Cottco) ginnery in Gokwe has resumed operations leading to the employment of thousands of people. Addressing villagers and Government officials at the commissioning of a recently completed Community Court for Chief Njelele in Gokwe recently, the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs in the Midlands province, Cde  Owen Ncube said under the new dispensation, the country was poised for socio-economic development. He said industries that had shrunk are now re-starting or boosting their operations across the country as the country is geared to achieve the targeted middle-income status by 2030. “Cottco ginnery that suspended operations several years ago, has resumed production and in the process creating thousands of jobs directly and indirectly. This is the trend across the country, thanks to the progressive polices of His Excellency, President E.D. Mnangagwa,” he said. Since President Mnangagwa assumed office in November 2017, the national economic outlook has started to bloom. “At this pace industry will thrive and production levels will be very high across all economic sectors. Social facilities such as schools, hospitals and other facilities will benefit from the economic turnaround,” said Cde Ncube. Cottco managing director Mr Pious Manamike told cotton stakeholders meeting at Gokwe ginnery that starting this coming season, the company was increasing input packages for hardworking farmers to boost production and increase export earnings. He said the Chief Njelele community court facility was the first of its kind not only in Gokwe South but the Midlands Province as a whole. Minister Ncube said Government was committed to improving the welfare and image of traditional leaders. @pchitumba1
