 Thandiwe Katinhimure, Business Reporter THE second edition of the CBZ Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) indaba begins in Bulawayo today with 500 delegates expected to attend. Representatives from India, Malawi and Namibia businesses are set to attend the three-day event, which seeks to capacitate the growing SMEs sector in Zimbabwe. CBZ confirmed in a notice that the event would be held at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) grounds. Bulawayo Chamber for SMEs Head Mr Energy Majazi said they will be taking part in the conference as it deals with their operations. “SMEs in the country need support from various players like CBZ and their zeal to support the SMEs is much welcomed,” he said. “It is critical to have funding and marketing exposure as SMEs because people have for a long time mistaken SMEs for vendors whereas SMEs are  also manufacturers who play an important role in the economy of the country.” Mr Majazi also pointed out that they were expecting the bank to avail packages that are affordable and accessible to SMEs. CBZ chief executive, Mr Peter Zimunya, has said his bank delights in assisting SMEs as they present a huge economic potential. “CBZ group celebrates success in supporting SMEs by having the following in place. A dedicated SMEs banking division, regional SMEs centres and SME centric products and financing solutions,” he was quoted as saying. CBZ has been at the forefront of supporting the growth of the SMEs sector and has won awards for supporting budding businesses. @thandyfeminine
