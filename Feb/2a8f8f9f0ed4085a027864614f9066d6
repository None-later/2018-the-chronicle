 Lovemore Zigara in Gweru THE Zimbabwe Softball Association (ZSA) have started regularising their operations to comply with the provisions of the Sports and Recreation Act. The Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) threatened to deregister associations, which are not compliant with statutory provisions. SRC also threatened to deregister some associations for failing to submit the following: annual reports, estimates of income and expenditure and audited financial statements. ZSA president Stonard Mapfumo said they had started a series of meetings that will culminate in an annual general meeting slated for March 10. He said his executive had called for a meeting in Harare this Saturday where stakeholders have been invited to “discuss all matters to do with softball and prepare for an elective annual general meeting in March”. “This year we want to be in good standing with the SRC and hence we have started a series of meetings with a view of ensuring we abide by the laws of the land,” said Mapfumo. “Some representatives at the meeting will be provincial associations, representatives from Nash, Naph as well as tertiary institutions, among others.” Apart from ZSA, other national sports associations that fall foul of the Sports and Recreation Act include the Zimbabwe Aerobics Sports Association, Zimbabwe Wrestling Federation, Zimbabwe National Bass Federation, Polo Association of Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe National Body Building and Wrestling Association, Zimbabwe Association of Sports for People with Disabilities, Zimbabwe Darts Association and the Zimbabwe Juskei Association. Meanwhile, a level one softball coaching workshop will run over the weekend targeting primary and secondary school coaches, as the association seeks to improve the game in the country. Mapfumo said the workshop is open to all coaches. @lavuzigara11
