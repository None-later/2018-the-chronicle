Conrad Mupesa, Harare Bureau GOVERNMENT will from next week start refurbishing sporting facilities at Mhangura and Alaska mines. The sporting facilities there were affected by the closure of the mines at the turn of the century. In a speech read on his behalf by director of sport, development and promotion, Eugania Chidhakwa during the 4th Edition of the Makonde Senator’s Sport Tournament in Chinhoyi during the weekend, Sport, Arts and Recreation Minister Kazemba Kazembe said the refurbishments were part of the ministry’s Rapid Results Initiatives. “The initiative seeks to proffer standardised hosting of events locally, regionally and internationally which, in our view as a Ministry, will contribute to the generation of podium-performance athletes,” he said.
