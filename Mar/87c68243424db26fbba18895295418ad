World Theatre Day is celebrated worldwide on March 27, although in Zimbabwe the celebrations started last week Thursday around the country. In Bulawayo, the celebrations will be punctuated by song and dance with Bambelela being joined by award winning Ezimnyama Dance Ensemble and Great Zimbabwe University Drama and Performing Arts Club at Matshobana Hall as from 2PM. The theme this year is “Take a child to Theatre today”. The two plays, The Naked Truth – a 2005 production written by renowned playwright Raisedon Baya tackles incest while Look, Listen and Decide is a 1994 production which tackles the plight of street children. Bambelela Arts Ensemble member Khumbulani Mathe said they were celebrating by reviving plays that they performed years back. He said issues to do with incest and the plight of street kids were still topical but were now being swept under the carpet. “People are concentrating on other concerns in society, but street kids are still here around us and they still have the same or even worse problems than before. Issues to do with incest are also more common than people want to acknowledge, so with these plays we want to bring out the issues,” said Mathe. Going along with the World Theatre Day theme, Mathe said the show was free of charge so as to encourage families to come and watch the plays. Naked Truth and Look, Listen and Decide will have a cast comprising Mathe, Tawanda Mkoma, Bongelani Ncube, Nyarai Ncube, Nomvelo Behane, Leonard Phiri and Prince Mangere.
