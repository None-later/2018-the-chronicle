Wilson Mutekede Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIFA technical director Wilson Mutekede has flown to Rabat, Morocco, for a technical directors’ workshop which seeks to standardise the coaching structure across football confederations. Zifa communications manager Xolisani Gwesela said the objective of the workshop is to review the entire Caf coaching system and align it with other confederations and obtain an equivalent agreement with them. “The workshop will also see deliberations on the introduction of the coaching licence convention,” said Gwesela. Opening the seminar last Friday, Caf executive committee member and Zambian football legend Kalusha Bwalya tasked participants to make good use of the opportunity to share and exchange knowledge provided by the workshop for the betterment of African football. Speaking at the same occasion, Caf deputy general secretary Anthony Baffoe emphasized the need to give more support to women’s football in the quest to take it to the next level. “We want to go to another level as we are looking for quality, whilst looking to strengthen other positions like women’s football. This is a new era and there’s a wind blowing to develop women’s football. The future starts with you (the participants) at this seminar. We are partnering with AFC, with the aim of getting closer to the level of Europe,” Baffoe said. Fifa senior technical development officer Jean Marie Conz and Caf technical consultant Jean-Michel Benezet are part of the gathering from 50 Caf member associations. — @skhumoyo2000
