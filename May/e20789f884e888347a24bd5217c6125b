Norman Matemera Harare Bureau ZIFA Referees Committee boss Gladmore Muzambi has commended the improved performance by local match officials this season. Although some coaches have been crying foul, Muzambi said he was happy with how their members have been executing their duties. “We haven’t received any official complaints from any of the clubs. But we are saying the teams should respect match officials’ decisions and where the officials make mistakes there are proper channels to be followed. “In terms of performance of our referees so far, it is better than last year. There has been a marked improvement. “Our review panel recently met and will be furnishing us with their report soon. They work with match commissioner’s reports. “If all our matches were being shown on television we could also use these clips for incidents,” he said. The former referee said the Zifa committee does not tolerate incompetent or corrupt referees contrary to the popular belief among supporters. “We take action if one is found guilty. There is prescribed action ranging from suspension, which can be from two matches and up to six months, depending on the severity of the offence. “More so we will publicise the matter because we pledge to be transparent in all our dealings with the officials. “We just encourage clubs to write to PSL, who then forward to Zifa, who in turn forward to the committee and communication will be given to the clubs along the same channel. ‘’But we are glad no reports have come so far this season,” said Muzambi. Top referee Norman Matemera has already officiated in five Caf matches while Nomore Musundire has handled three matches. “Now that the competition is into the group stages we hope the referees will continue to get appointed. “Currently, Musundire is going to officiate at the Cosafa Cup and is already in South Africa where they have just concluded the fitness tests,” said Muzambi.
