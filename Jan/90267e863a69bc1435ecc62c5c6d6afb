Mr Sifelani Jabangwe Prince Sunduzani, Business Reporter THE Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) has postponed its economic outlook symposium that was scheduled for this week to next week in order to accommodate some officials attending the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. President Emmerson Mnangagwa is leading a delegation comprising some Cabinet Ministers, Government officials and representatives from the private sector at the global business meeting which ends today in Davos. In an interview, CZI president Mr Sifelani Jabangwe said the symposium which was scheduled for January 24 would now be held on January 30. He said outputs from the President’s visit to Switzerland will also feed into the symposium. At the upcoming symposium, the Government and the private sector are expected to deliberate on business strategies that the country needs to adopt this year and beyond. “We postponed the symposium because of the meeting in Davos. The outputs of that meeting will also feed into our symposium. “All principals are out and we want the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (Dr John Mangudya) and the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning (Cde Patrick Chinamasa) to attend the symposium. The RBZ Governor has indicated that he will attend the symposium, which is very important,” said Mr Jabangwe. The forthcoming symposium comes at a time when the Government under the new political dispensation has announced a number of measures to promote the ease of doing business and creating a friendly investment environment. In the 2018 national budget, the Government announced a number of measures to promote economic growth. — @PrinceNkosy102.
