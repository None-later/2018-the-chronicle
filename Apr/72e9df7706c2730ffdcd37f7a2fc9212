 Lovemore Zigara in Gweru SHURUGWI-based Nichrut have declared war on Caps United when the two sides clash at Ascot Stadium in a Castle Lager premiership encounter this afternoon. The premiership debutants have surprised all and sundry with their decent displays and find themselves in ninth position with as many points. For a team which had been touted as relegation candidates, Mushonga Unouraya Ipapo Ipapo have done very well and the clash against Caps United will put their pedigree under scrutiny. The Shurugwi-based outfit has been found wanting playing against the league’s big guns having lost to Ngezi Platinum and Highlanders. However, Nichrut gaffer John Nyikadzino believes his side will turn a new leaf when they face the Green Machine. “It is a big game for us but we have prepared well for it. We want to give our fans something to smile about as you know we are still to collect maximum points at Ascot (Stadium) and it will be good to do it against Caps United,” he said. “We know they are a big institution but our respect for them ends there as we mean serious business. We have worked on our mistakes which saw us lose to Ngezi Platinum and Highlanders,” added Nyikadzino. Nichrut will be looking for inspiration from Nigel Mpinduki who has been a revelation for the league debutants. However, the Green Machine will not be pushovers and would also be looking to collect maximum points to remain in the title hunt. Lloyd Chitembwe’s men will be buoyed by their 1 – 0 win against bitter rivals Dynamos last weekend and would want to continue on the same trajectory. — @lavuzigara1
