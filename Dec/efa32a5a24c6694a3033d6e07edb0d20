The Chronicle Response to “Illegal fuel dealers face arrest”. It’s good to just arrest before warning them. If it’s illegal, people want to see the results. — Nathaniel Response to “America’s ‘friend’ Biti must come clean”. I am sure Biti is well aware of American chicanery. They use a person and when they are done with him, they just dump him. So why worry? His former boss in Morgan Tsvangirai (MHSRIP) was a victim of the same shameless American behaviour. Let him join the long list of the Tsvangirais, Savimbis, Does, Mobutus, Tshombes, Noriegas, Saddams, etc. And where does Chamisa stand in this dirty game? Looks like the jecha boy is not in the good books of the Americans. Is it because of his admiration for former president Robert Mugabe that worked against him with the Americans? Americans would be happy to unleash Biti than Chamisa. Perhaps the jecha boy makes too much noise like a chihuahua and Biti is the bulldog that hardly barks. — Masaisai Response to, “Vanguard turns on MDC-Alliance protestors”. Nelson Chamisa lied under oath before the Commission of Inquiry that the MDC vanguard had been disbanded, but just on Tuesday the group unleashed an orgy of violence against party members. Chamisa should rein in his violent machine and stop playing saint when behind the scenes he is busy psyching up these hooligans. In the spirit of unity, Chamisa should behave like the pastor he wants people to believe he is. He should learn from President Mnangagwa who preaches peace. — Elijah Chihota
