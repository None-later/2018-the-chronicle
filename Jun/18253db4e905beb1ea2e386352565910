Elvis ‘Bulawayo Bomber’ Moyo Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter WORLD Boxing Federation (WBF) All-Africa heavyweight champion Elvis Moyo has been presented with a lifetime opportunity to fight Commonwealth champion Joe Joyce in London this month. Moyo, who has been hoping to break into the competitive and lucrative European market, had his prayers answered when WBF president Howard Goldberg called his team notifying him of the proposed fight against Joyce. Moyo has about 10 days to prepare for what could be a career-changing fight against Joyce at York Hall, one of the best known boxing venues in London, on June 15. Despite limited time to prepare, the Zimbabwean pugilist is excited and has intensified his preparations for the fight. “I’ve been offered a fight in England against Joe Joyce and I’m super excited. Right now I’m waiting for the finer details, but the person making this fight possible is Howard Goldberg (WBF president). Even if I have 10 days to prepare, it’s an opportunity which I can’t let go. I’ve upped my training,” said Moyo from his Johannesburg base yesterday. Moyo’s last fight was in April when he knocked out Ukrainian Maksym Pedyura in Harare. The Bulawayo Bomber floored the Ukrainian boxer after two minutes 49 seconds in the first-round. “How I wish I had gone beyond the first round against Pedyura. I’m not making any excuses; I’ll train hard and make sure I’m in the best shape. It’s a challenge which I have to take. For the next three days I’ll be doing cardio, then next week we will be doing sparring,” said Moyo. He has a fair record of W7-KO4;L5;D2, while Joyce, who according to online reports is being promoted by David Haye, has had four career fights, with a W4-KO4 record. Joyce’s last fight was on May 5 at the O2 Arena where he knocked out Jamaica’s Lenroy Thomas inside two rounds.  — @ZililoR
