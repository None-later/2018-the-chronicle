Mr Christopher Dube Andile Tshuma, Chronicle Correspondent THE Bulawayo City Council (BCC) has availed more than 700 housing stands as it pushes to address the ever ballooning housing backlog, a senior council official has said. BCC Town Clerk Mr Christopher Dube in a press statement said beneficiaries should be on council’s housing waiting list. The smallest stand in Pumula with 200 square metres will cost $4 500 excluding VAT of $675 while the biggest stand in high density suburb at 600 square metres will cost $9 000 excluding $1 350 VAT. The smallest stand in the medium density suburb will be 640 square metres valued at $9 600 excluding $1440 VAT and the biggest stand at 1500 square metres will go for $20 300 excluding $3 045 VAT. Mr Dube said interested applicants must register between June 27 and July 6. There are 502 stands in Emhlangeni medium density suburb and 233 high density stands in Pumula South. A resident, Mr Mehluli Dawu said he hopes to get the stand as he had been on the housing waiting list for the past 12 years. “I have renewed and I hope to get a stand at Emhlangeni. I will still settle for Pumula South if I fail to secure one in Emhlangeni which is my fist preference,’ said Mr Dawu. Ms Sheila Maphosa said she had been turned away as she was not a holder of a valid form for a housing waiting list. “I had the money but the officials screening people in the queue said they are only taking people on the council waiting list. So I am now preparing to apply to be on the list and hope to get a stand in the next batch that council is going to avail,” said Ms Maphosa. BCC has over the years been failing to develop and service stands due to financial constraints. As a result, the housing waiting list has remained high at over 100 000. – @andile_tshuma
