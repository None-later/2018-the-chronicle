Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter A NEW state-of-the-art music studio has been opened in Gwanda and it is hoped it will improve the quality of music for Matabeleland South artistes. The studio named PM Studios is owned by Prophet Tatenda Makasi of Destiny Encounter Ministries and is open to all artistes regardless of their genre. The opening of the studio was attended by many community leaders in Gwanda who said it will help reduce crime as many youths will have something to do. A number of talented youths in Gwanda have failed to make a breakthrough mainly because of the poor quality of music. “We thank God we now have a state-of-the-art studio in Gwanda and we hope artistes especially the young ones will take advantage of this studio to produce quality music,” Prophet Makasi said. The studio has so far recorded a hip-hop track for a Bulawayo-based author and motivational speaker Marshall Chiza. The song titled, I’m a Billionaire, is already being played by local radio stations in Bulawayo. Nomalanga Sibanda who sourced the studio equipment said the objective is to assist local musicians. @mthabisi_mthire
