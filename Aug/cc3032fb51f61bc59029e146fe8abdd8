 Cape Town — World champion Caster Semenya led from the front again as South Africa continued their fine form on the final day of the 21st African Athletics Championships in Asaba. Semenya took her second gold medal in Nigeria, this time in the women’s 800m final yesterday. The two-time Olympic champion stopped the clock in a time of 1:56.06 at the Stephen Keshi Stadium. Semenya broke an African record held by her idol Maria Mutola, which the Mozambican icon ran at the 1993 African Championships in Durban (1:56.36). Burundian Francine Niyonsaba took silver in 1:57.97 and Bayih Habitam Alemu of Ethiopia took bronze in a time of 1:58.86. On Friday, Semenya smashed a 18-year-old national record previously held by Heide Seyerling in the women’s 400m final —becoming the first SA woman to dip under 50 seconds. South African sprinter Ncincilili Titi romped to gold in the men’s 200m final crossing the finish line in 20.46 seconds as fellow countryman Luxolo Adams claimed bronze in 20.60 seconds. Cornel Fredericks took silver in the men’s 400m hurdles in a time of 49.40 seconds —behind gold medallist Abdelmalik Lahoulou of Algeria (48.47). Wenda Nel grabbed a bronze medal in the women’s 400m hurdles final in 57:04 seconds behind gold medallist Glory Nathaniel of Nigeria (55:53) and silver medallist Moroccan Lamiae Lhabz (56:66). — Sport24
