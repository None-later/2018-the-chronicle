 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter DEFENDING national 10km cross-country champions, Bulawayo province, have vowed to defend the title they won last year. This year’s national finals will be held at Hillside Dams on February 10, with Team Bulawayo counting on their knowledge of the terrain to win. Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) chairperson Manuel Mpofu said Bulawayo were ready to prove that last year’s win was no fluke. “We have assembled a strong squad that we are confident will emulate last year’s performance. Athletes were selected on the strengths of their performance in the two cross country events we held to start the new year,” said Mpofu. “The team will meet regularly for training under the supervision of experienced coaches. We are confident of having a great year.” The Bulawayo squad will be trained by Nosimilo Sibanda, Bhaar Mpofu and Benson Mwanza. Among accomplished cross country runners the province will bank on are Xolani Nkiwane, Isaac Mpofu and Trust Chidomaya in the senior men’s category. The senior women’s side will pin its hopes on the likes of Annie Chirisa and Liner Tom. @innocentskizoe
