Xolani Mumba Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter TSHOLOTSHO district teachers yesterday began a two-day Technical Officials Education and Certification System (TOECS) athletics workshop that is meant to equip them ahead of the provincial National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) track and field competitions that the district will be hosting. The district will play host to the provincial finals from March 8-9 at Mavela and Tsholotsho High School grounds respectively. “The course is meant to equip our teachers with the know how in athletics as we prepare to host the provincial finals next month. Those who will attend will get a Level One TOECS coaching certificate,” said the Nash Tsholotsho district head-in-charge of athletics Phillip Phiri of Mathe Secondary School. He said International Association of Athletics Federation TOECS accredited officials Tawanda Mutero and Xolani Mumba will conduct the two-day course. TOECS’ goal is to improve the level of athletics officiating all over the world. The TOECS features standard learning materials and specifically trained lecturers for three levels of courses. Level One provides participants with the theoretical and practical training required to enable them to officiate at national and international competitions. The Level One course also identifies candidates for the position of national technical official. Level One courses are organised by the member federation, but for approved courses, the IAAF supplies the necessary materials. Participants that successfully complete the course will receive an IAAF Level One Officiating Certificate and will be eligible to attend the Level Two course. — @skhumoyo2000
