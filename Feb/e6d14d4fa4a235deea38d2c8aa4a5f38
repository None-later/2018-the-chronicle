 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter TAWANDA Makombe and Marry Macheka scooped the most valuable player accolades in the male and female categories of the Bulawayo Volleyball Association (BVA) awards for the 2017 season on Saturday. BVA honoured teams, players and coaches, who excelled in the 2017 season at an awards ceremony held at the Praise and Worship Centre. Makombe and Macheka were also named as the men’s and women’s best attackers in what was a successful season for the Spartans duo. Macheka was the biggest winner on the night as she was also named the women’s best blocker to cap a hat-trick of awards, while Spartans’ Willig Mavi was named the men’s best blocker. Jennifer Tembo of Spartans and Luveve High School’s Evans Ncube were named the league’s most promising players. Spartans’ veteran coach Vulindlela Moyo was presented with the technical lifetime achievement award for his illustrious work in the growth of volleyball. Fredrick Ndlovu was also honoured with a life time achievement award for his work in administration, while Sikhumbuzo Gwala was named referee of the year. BVA chairperson William Mazviro said they were hoping to make the awards a yearly event. “This was our inaugural edition of the awards and we are happy with the way things went. We are certainly looking to grow from here. We believe this is the start of a yearly programme that will go a long way in motivating the players. We would to thank those who sponsored the event; that is Four Ways Driving School, KSN and Supreme Media Designs, for making this a special day,” said Mazviro. BVA remains optimistic of sparking a renewed interest in volleyball in Bulawayo. The Bulawayo community displayed their affection for volleyball by thronging the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) during the 2017 African Volleyball Confederation (CAVB) Zone VI Club Volleyball championships in December last year. @innocentskizoe
