Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent THE Zanu-PF Youth League has urged Zimbabweans to use tomorrow’s National Youth Day public holiday to reflect on challenges affecting young people and think of the best ways to alleviate those problems. The holiday, celebrated for the first time, is in honour of former President Cde Robert Mugabe’s contributions towards young people. In previous years, it was referred to as the 21st February Movement celebrations which also coincided with Cde Mugabe’s birthday. He turns 94 tomorrow. Zanu-PF Secretary for Youth Affairs Cde Pupurai Togarepi yesterday said tomorrow’s holiday should be celebrated with the youth in mind. He said as a party they would also use the day to shower the former President with gifts while seeking guidance from their icon. “He is our icon. We will do whatever we can to come up with a memorable day for him. He is our leader and we will do as much as we can,” said Cde Togarepi. “On a birthday there are a lot of gifts that are given to the person marking a birthday, we are also going to give him a cake. If he has time, he will sit down with the youths, tell them the journey he has travelled and express to them things that he would wish youths could take seriously as they develop into future leaders.” Cde Togarepi said the youths would also use the day to exhibit traits of responsibility. “So it our wish as the Zanu-PF Youth League to involve ourselves in activities that further youth interests on that day. We are going to start by exhibiting traits of responsible youths,” he said. “We are also going to talk about issues affecting youths such as unemployment, education and skills that are needed. We will be exchanging ideas on how we can tackle our future socially, economically and politically.” @nqotshili
