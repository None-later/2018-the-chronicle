 Codelia Mondela, Court Reporter A BULAWAYO man has been sentenced to 10 years in jail for raping his seven-year-old niece who had been left in his custody. The man, who is 21-years-old, threatened the child with death if she reported what happened to her to anyone. He pleaded guilty to rape charges before Bulawayo regional magistrate Mrs Sibongile Msipa-Marondedze. The magistrate said he was a youthful offender who did not waste time by pleading guilty and the court would therefore, temper mercy with justice. She sentenced him to 10 years in prison and three years were suspended on condition that he does not repeat a similar offence in the next five years. Asked why he raped his niece, the man said he did not know why he committed the offence as he came to his senses after he had already raped her. For the State, Miss Concilia Ncube said the man raped the child last Thursday in the presence of her two younger sisters both aged three-years-old. “The children’s mother left them with the man while she went to the city centre. The man entered into the spare bedroom where they were playing and pushed the child onto the bed. When she cried he threatened to cut off her head,” she said. “The two younger children ran and hid under a small table. He raped the child and she did not tell anyone about the matter until after two days.” The prosecutor said she started complaining that she was experiencing pain on her private parts. “Her mother checked the minor and discovered puss coming out of her privates. The child disclosed what her uncle had done to her and he was arrested,” she said. @MondelaC
