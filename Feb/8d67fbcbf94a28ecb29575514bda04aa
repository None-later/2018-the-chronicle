Cal_vin Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent THE impasse between Cal Vin and local commercial radio station Skyz Metro FM has been resolved and the embargo on playing the rapper’s music has been lifted. On Tuesday, pictures were shared of Cal Vin and the station manager Godwin Phiri on the Skyz Metro FM Facebook page captioned: “The ‘hatchet’ has been buried. Music wins, always.” Before that, Cal Vin had appeared on the Vuka Vuka Breakfast show. The beef began last year when Cal Vin ordered the radio station to remove his music from their playlist. This was after Skyz Metro FM had delayed the rapper’s payment after he performed at their first anniversary celebrations at White City Stadium. This angered Cal Vin who launched verbal vitriol on micro blogging site Twitter with unprintable words and ultimately ordered the station to remove his music, of which Skyz Metro FM obliged. The cold war also saw the artiste not getting nominated for the radio station’s inaugural awards held in December last year. During yesterday’s Vuka Vuka Breakfast show, Cal Vin said it was time for the two to bury the hatchet. Phiri said Cal Vin approached them so as to iron out issues. Not going into the details of their discussion with Cal Vin, Phiri said their role as a radio station was to promote the arts and music was the winner at the end of the day. “Cal Vin came through and we had a discussion. I won’t get into details of the dialogue we had but the outcome is that our role as a radio station is to promote artistes. Cal Vin is one of those artistes we have a responsibility to promote,” said Phiri. “We have since added Cal Vin’s music to the playlist and actually played two of his songs on Skyz Metro FM today.” In future, Phiri encouraged artistes to visit the station whenever they have challenges and not rant on social media.
