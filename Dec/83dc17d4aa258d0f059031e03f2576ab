EMAKHANDENI Tennis Club’s 15-year-old player Zamani Moyo claimed the Under-18 gold medal at a four-day New Winners’ Tournament in Harare. The young gem recorded four successive wins in a round robin tournament and went on to beat the host city’s Shayn Tapera in the final. Prior to the New Winners’ Tournament in the capital, Moyo claimed silver in an Under-18 tennis championship in Mutare after losing to Anesu Kwirirayi of Mutare in the final. Moyo is proving to be a rising star since he joined the club in 2014 and has represented Zimbabwe on the international stage. He represented Zimbabwe in the 2016 legs of the African Junior Championships in Botswana and South Africa. Emakhandeni Tennis Club chairman Witness Jiyane said he is happy with Moyo’s progress and the club will continue supporting him. “I have no words to describe how happy and proud we’re as a result of his achievements. “His dedication and talent is unquestionable and it is up to us to ensure that he is well catered for so that he attends every tennis tournament,” said Jiyane. He said tennis is a sport which needs one to be active all the time hence the need for one to participate in as many competitions. “Zamani is a future star and sometimes he amazes me with the effort he puts when practising. “He cries after losing a match or when we fail to organise transport money for him to participate in a tournament,” Jiyane said. – @DecoDecent2
