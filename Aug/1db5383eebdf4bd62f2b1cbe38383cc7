Chief Justice Luke Malaba Daniel Nemukuyu, Harare Bureau Chief Justice Luke Malaba does not own a Twitter account and the nation should not be misled by statements posted on bogus accounts created in his name by mischievous elements, the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) has said. Some fraudsters have duped the public into believing that the judiciary boss was running a Twitter account “@LukeMalaba” which has a picture of High Court judges wearing their red robes. The fake account was created this month and by yesterday, it had registered 40 followers. The account purports to have been created by Chief Justice Malaba and his picture in court regalia was attached to mislead the unsuspecting public. The JSC has since made a report to the police on the case. In a statement, JSC Acting Secretary Mr Walter Chikwana rubbished the Twitter account, saying it was a malicious act of fraudsters calculated at misleading the nation. “We wish to inform members of the public that the account is a fraudulent creation of mischievous elements bent on misleading the public,” he said. “The Chief Justice does not and has never handled a Twitter account.” Mr Chikwana said people should disregard any statements posted on the bogus Twitter account.
