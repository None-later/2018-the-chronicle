Leonard Ncube, in Victoria Falls A 73-year-old Finnish man completed his 98th marathon in 98 countries at the Econet Victoria Falls Marathon on Sunday. Tenho Lauri from the Finland capital Helsinki said had set himself a target of hitting a century of marathons in 100 countries.He said he started his journey to this record at the age of 55. Before that, Lauri said he was into skiing in northern Finland. “I started when I was 55 and would go to many countries in Europe. I then started to travel further and have been to the Bahamas, South Africa, Botswana, Cameroon, Nigeria, Kenya and Tunisia where I have participated in marathons,” said Lauri. “This is the first time I have come to Victoria Falls and next I am going to Paraguay and then Sydney in Australia. After 100 countries I will then slow down and maybe just go to a few that I like and participate there. That will of course depend on my health,” he said. Lauri said he started by running half marathons before switching to full marathons in which he used to clock just above four hours. He completed Sunday’s marathon in just over five hours. Lauri said he enjoyed the Victoria Falls marathon course and will consider returning for the event next year.“This is a very good place. I enjoyed the race, but I am not yet sure whether I am coming back.” @ncubeleon
