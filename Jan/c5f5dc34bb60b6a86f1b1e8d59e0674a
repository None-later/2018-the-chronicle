The informant alerted the police who attended the scene. Indications are that the woman could have been raped before she was murdered. “She was blindfolded with a cloth and she had bruises on her body. The body was taken to Gwanda Provincial Hospital Mortuary for post mortem. Investigations are underway to ascertain the cause of the woman’s death and no arrests have been made so far,” he said.

He said she was last seen by a relative who met her in Gwanda Town on Saturday afternoon. “My niece was now staying alone and she was performing piece jobs to earn a living. A relative met her on Saturday afternoon and they had a little chat. We were shocked when we learnt that she had been murdered. “Hopefully the post mortem will shed more light on this matter as we are puzzled on who could have attacked her and the motive behind the incident. This incident has really left the family saddened as it was so sudden,” he said. Cde Nkomo said it was their hope as a family that the assailant would be arrested and brought to book. @DubeMatutu
