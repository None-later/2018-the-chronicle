Hardlife Zvirekwi Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter A medical expert has given hope to Caps United skipper Hardlife Zvirekwi that his playing career may not be over after his left hand was amputated just after the wrist following a road traffic accident on Monday morning. There were fears that the 30-year-old utility player might not play professional football again as a result of the amputation, which was confirmed by Caps United chief executive officer Cuthbert Chitima. “Yes, he was amputated just after the wrist,” said Chitima. Zvirekwi becomes the second high profile Zimbabwean player to be amputated after former steely Hwange defender Brian Njobvu’s leg was amputated after he was accidentally run over by a team bus during a pre-season trip to Victoria Falls in 2001. Njobvu never saw action again as a player, but is now a qualified coach. Renowned City doctor Xolani Ndlovu said Zvirekwi’s condition did not necessarily mark the end of his playing career. “He can still play professional football; it’s not the end of his career,” said the former Highlanders FC medical doctor. He said barring any post operation complications, the diminutive Warriors’ player could be back on the field of play in six weeks’ time. “It may be up to six weeks to recover, assuming no post operation complications arise,” said Ndlovu. The late former VFB Stuttgart player Robert Schlienz had his left forearm amputated following a horrific car accident on August 14, 1948, but made a dramatic comeback on December 5 of the same year. Despite the amputation, Schlienz captained VFB Stuttgart and led them to the German Championship twice in 1950 and 1952, and they were runners-up in 1953 and lifted the German Cup twice in 1954 and 1958. In 1955 and 1956, he earned three caps for West Germany under famous coach Sepp Herberger. @skhumoyo2000
