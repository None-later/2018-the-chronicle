 Shamiso Dzingire, Business Reporter AIR Zimbabwe has launched a promotion where customers get a free flight after every four flights to boost trade and domestic tourism. The promotion, dubbed “#Fly4Free,” was launched last Friday and will run up to September 30. In an interview with Business Chronicle yesterday, Air Zimbabwe corporate services manager Mr Tafadzwa Mazonde, said the promotion was a reward to their customers who have continued to support the airliner despite the challenges bedevilling the parastatal. “This is a reward package and a thank you to our valued and loyal customers who have, and still continue to fly with Air Zimbabwe despite all the challenges which have bedevilled the national airline in the recent past,” he said. Mr Mazonde said the national airline supports and subscribes to President Mnangagwa’s “Zimbabwe is Open for Business” mantra through facilitating trade and domestic tourism. “The #Fly4Free promotion is specifically targeted at our domestic routes promoting and enabling travel for business and leisure to Bulawayo and Victoria Falls which has also been designated as a Special Economic Zone,” he said. Domestically, Air Zimbabwe plies the Harare-Bulawayo and Harare-Victoria Falls routes. The promotion, said Mr Mazonde, has been received well by customers as reflected in the queries and bookings they have received since the launch. “The promotion is now in its fourth day and our customers are excited about it if the enquiries and booking plans are anything to go by. “The booking plan helps customers to start building their trips and qualify for this exciting promotion,” he added. The #Fly4Free promotion comes at a time when low cost airliner fastjet Zimbabwe announced that it will launch daily flights between Harare and Bulawayo with the first flight scheduled for Friday, July 20. @ShamisoDzingire
