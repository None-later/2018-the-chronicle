BaShupi Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent WHAT was supposed to be a surprise for fans by singer Trevor Dongo ended up being a surprise for him as BaShupi stole the show at Private Lounge Bulawayo on Friday night. The musician was part of the acts that had been invited on stage by Trevor D during his show for the strippers and patrons. Joining Trevor D as one of his surprise acts, BaShupi took to the stage and went through his repertoire of songs and surprisingly he got the revellers on the dance floor and singing along. The stage that is normally meant for strip tease was turned into a bedrock for love jams from the melodious voice of Trevor D after BaShupi and other musicians. When Trevor D got on stage he was met with wild cheers from the ladies who normally entertain patrons for tips. The ladies were so excited that they had abandoned the male patrons who sat waiting patiently as they enjoyed the music that Trevor D was churning out.
