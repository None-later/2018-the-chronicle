Eddie Toriro Showbiz Correspondent THREE of the local entertainment industry’s heavyweights have teamed up for one big party that will be held at two venues this Saturday in Bulawayo. Judgement Yard’s DJ Flevah, 3D Events co-founder Eddie Toriro and veteran nightclub manager, Manu Mahaso, will be celebrating their birthdays at Hartsfield Tshisanyama and Cosmopolitan Night club. The party will start at Hartsfield Tshisanyama at 6PM where Toriro and DJ Flevah will be the guests of honour at their VIP Birthday party that is themed blue denim and white. Later on in the night the party will shift to Cosmopolitan Night Club where they will join Manu Mahaso for the three to celebrate their birthdays. At Hartsfield Tshisanyama, DJs Victor Bravo, DJ Teddy from South Africa and Champion Sounds will be taking care of business alongside 3D Family DJs. At Cosmopolitan it will be a Triple Threat birthday bash and DJs Teddy, Liz and Boss Jagwe will be joined by Judgement Yard. DJ Flevah “Our birthdays are close together so we decided to combine the celebration. Preparations for the parties are going on well as we want to make it a night to remember for the patrons who support us,” said Mahaso. Toriro said the party was a continuation of the tradition of celebrating his birthday with DJ Flevah as they were born on the same day, February 28. “DJ Flevah and I were born on the same day so for the past three years, we’ve been jointly celebrating our birthdays. This year it’s different because we’ll be joining Manu Mahaso at Cosmo for the Triple Threat as an after party of our birthday bash,” said Toriro.
