 N’Djamena — The government of Chad on Wednesday suspended 10 opposition parties for “disturbing public order” and “inciting violence” after they backed trade union calls for a mass protest over austerity measures. The parties’ activities “have been suspended for a duration of two months,” Security Minister Ahmat Mahamat Bachir said in a statement. Citing security reasons, the authorities also announced on the radio that a march scheduled for yesterday by civil groups, trade unions and opposition politicians had been banned. The impoverished Sahel state is imposing cuts in public spending that the finance ministry says are vital to stave off bankruptcy. The cuts have increased social tension and anger at President Idriss Deby, in power since 1990. The 10 suspended parties include the Democratic Party of the Chadian People (PDPT), led by lawmaker Djimet Clement Bagao, which took part in a march on Tuesday called by unions. The demonstration was dispersed by police, causing injuries, according to the opposition. Chad is under pressure to cut costs to meet performance targets under an International Monetary Fund (IMF) aid programme. The IMF opened up a $312m credit line last June. To gain a second tranche of credit, Chad has to improve its state finances and conclude negotiations with commodities trader Glencore over a debt of $1.45bn, according to an informed source. A Western ally in combating jihadism in the volatile Sahara region, Chad has endured two years of severe recession worsened by a slump in oil prices. — AP
