Tirivashe Nheweyembwa Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE training of provincial accreditation officers for next month’s Zimbabwe National Youth and Paralympics Games in the Midlands province will be done on Friday, while recruitment of volunteers will be done on Saturday. Provinces are also expected to submit their team’s names on Saturday as the countdown to this year’s games continues. According to agreed guidelines, all provinces must have paid their full participation fees by August 10. Participation fees were pegged at $70 per individual. Last week Sports and Recreation Commission spokesperson Tirivashe Nheweyembwa said Matabeleland South and Mashonaland West provinces were the first to pay their 50 percent participation deposit, which he said will go a long way in assisting the local organising committee prepare for the games. Nheweyembwa said funding will be expected to come from the Government, participation fees as well as the corporate world. “A total budget of $ 1.1 million in cash and kind is required and this requires that we join hands and work as one people so that we make the games a resounding success. The budget will be financed through modest contributions from the Government, participation fees which have been pegged at $70 per participant and fundraising efforts,” said Nheweyembwa. He said fundraising efforts have been extended to district administrators in the Midlands province as well as traditional chiefs. “Our belief is that everyone has a role to play in ensuring that the games are a success and follow ups will be made with the respective offices or organisations so that they may support the Games,” he said.
