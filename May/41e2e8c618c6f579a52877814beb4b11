Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (NAAZ) will be holding a workshop at White City Stadium next month as it continues with efforts to improve the standard of athletics in the country. The course will run from June 9-10 with the registration fee pegged at $50. Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) chairperson Manuel Mpofu said registration for the course is already underway with teachers being the main target. “The course will target mainly the school teachers as they are the ones that work with these young athletes on a more regular basis. Our target for the guys who will attend the training will be for them to work with the youth, clubs and schools. We want them to establish vibrant clubs that will produce quality athletes. “We expect them to impart the correct skills to those they will go back to teach. The other pivotal aspect is for these guys will be to work with schools because they have the resources. We want to do away with the mindset of viewing athletics as a termly thing. “Athletics should be done throughout the year if we are to improve the sport in the country. The kids athletics event we are going to be teaching will play a pivotal role in ensuring the development and nurturing of talent at a young age,” said Mpofu. Zimbabwe picked nine medals, including three gold at the African Junior Championships in Algeria and one of the athletes reached the 800m finals at the World Youth Championships in Kenya and  will be looking forward to an improved outing at the World Junior Championships in Finland later this year. — @innocentskizoe
