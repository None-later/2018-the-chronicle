The matter was then referred back to the NPA. “The conferment of diplomatic immunity on [Mugabe] is null and void, as the court has decided. We leave it to the NPA to see the way forward‚” international relations and cooperation minister Lindiwe Sisulu said in August. The DA and AfriForum applied to have Mugabe’s diplomatic immunity revoked after she allegedly assaulted South African model Gabriella Engels at a hotel in Johannesburg in 2017. Mugabe allegedly assaulted Engels after she found the model partying with her two sons at a Sandton hotel. Engels suffered serious injuries‚ including a gash on her forehead. While charges were laid‚ Mugabe was controversially allowed to leave the country after the government granted her diplomatic immunity. timeslive.co.za
