 Lisa Mangena, Court Reporter A MAN from Cowdray Park suburb in Bulawayo told a court he “was tempted by an unlocked door” after he was arrested for allegedly stealing seven cell phones, $320 and a waist belt. Dingani Mpofu (42) allegedly found the door unlocked at Mr Anele Ntuliki’s house in Tshabalala and took cell phones, a black waist belt as well as some money that was in the house. Mpofu was not asked to plead to theft when he appeared before Western Commonage Magistrate Ms Tancy Dube. He was remanded out of custody to August 29. Prosecuting Ms Sibekithemba Dube said: “On February 3, Mr Ntuliki retired to bed leaving his main door unlocked. Mpofu proceeded to Mr Ntuliki’s house and noticed the house was open and stole cell phones”. Ms Dube said in the morning, Ntuliki realised his door was open and some phones were missing. He searched the house to see if there was something else missing and discovered his money had been stolen too. A report was filed at Tshabalala police station and upon investigations, two of his cell phones were recovered as well as the belt. Mpofu was arrested following the recovery of the stolen stuff. He apologised to the court saying he never intended to steal but was tempted by the unlocked door.—@LissahMangena
