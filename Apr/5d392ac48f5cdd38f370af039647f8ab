DJ Flevah and Ertherton in Victoria Falls Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter HARARE reggae/dancehall movement – Judgement Yard – put up a spirited back-to-back performance over the weekend in Victoria Falls leaving fans asking for more. DJ Flevah and chanter Etherton B played here on Friday and Saturday night at Comfort Pub and Grill at well attended shows. On Friday, the crew played until 3AM. Saturday night was more electrified as the duo continued from where they left off, dishing out hit and yesteryear tracks, taking an appreciative crowd that included tourists, down memory lane. Speaking after the two shows, Comfort Pub and Grill proprietor Nicholas Mukarati said they had to vet the crowds who thronged the venue in numbers. “We’re happy that the crew delivered a fantastic performance. We tried to control the crowd because of the size of our establishment and to avoid unruly behaviour. This worked because we didn’t have any incidents of violence.” This show, Mukarati said, was the beginning of more high profile events to come for music lovers in the resort town.  – @ncubeleon
