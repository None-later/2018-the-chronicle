 Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE netball team coach Lloyd Makunde says there is need for them to up their game as they begin preparations for the African Championships in Lusaka, Zambia, next month. The championships are scheduled for August 13 to 19 and are serving as a qualifier for the 2019 World Cup in Liverpool, England. Makunde has drafted an 18-member provisional team, retaining the bulk of the players who competed at the Pent Series in Namibia last month. He has also roped in goal-shooters Tafadzwa Mawango, Sharon Bwanali and Claris Kwaramba, who were part of the Under-21 team that took part at the World Youth Cup last year in Botswana. The camp was initially set to start on Sunday but players started reporting for duty on Monday as some were committed to their clubs. ‘’We are expecting all our players to be in by tonight. So, tomorrow, we are actually starting practice. ‘’We have added in new faces in Tafadzwa Mawango, a goal-shooter from Correctional and we didn’t have Christine (Kadandara) the last time. “There is also Sharon Bwanali, she is goal-shooter and it’s her first time in the senior team. There is another new face in Claris Kwaramba, she was in the Under-21 team that went to Botswana,’’ said Makunde. Makunde expressed concern over the fitness level of the players. Provisional Team Pauline Jani, Perpetua Siyachitema, Cynthia Gamuchirayi, Rudo Karume, Ursula Ndlovu, Ndaiziveyi Madzikangava, Media Mafuta, Alice Banda, Patricia Mauladi, Edna Nyamhazha, Tafadzwa Mawango, Tafadzwa Matura, Claris Kwaramba, Mercy Mukwadi , Sharon Bwanali, Felistas Kwangwa, Christine Kadandara,  Portia Miti.
