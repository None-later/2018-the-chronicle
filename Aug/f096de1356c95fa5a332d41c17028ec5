Descent Dube, Sports Reporter THE annual Lake Harvest Kariba Challenge which incorporates a half-marathon and 10km race takes place in Kariba this weekend. The event, which is managed by the Harare Round Table Number One, an association of men aged 18 to 25, is held every year over the Heroes’ weekend to raise funds for several charities. The half-marathon event is a 21.1km run, but there is a 10km race for those that feel the half-marathon is a bit too much for them. There is also a short children’s run for those up to the age of 12. On Saturday the focus will be on children, with a Kids’ Fishing Tournament at the Kariba Bream Farm in Chawara and other fun events, including children’s movies. NMB Bank marketing manager Lindiwe Thebethebe said her company was happy to be among the sponsors of the event. “Past participants in the half-marathon have included runners, who have been among the top runners in the South African Comrades Marathon and Two Oceans Marathon, as well as local runners, who have excelled in local and international runs,” said Thebethebe. “The event promises to be exciting and fun-filled for families as well as runners and supporters. “Not only is running a good way to stay healthy, (but) the Kariba Challenge benefits a number of worthy charities,” she said. The Kariba Animal Welfare Trust, which treats injured or distressed wild animals, has joined the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority in anti-snare patrols and is among the charities set to benefit from the Kariba Challenge. Among other beneficiaries is the Tony Waite Organisation, which assists orphans and vulnerable children, and the Greendale Senior Citizens Trust.
