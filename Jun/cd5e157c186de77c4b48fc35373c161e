 Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter A POLICE officer stationed at Binga Police Station has been arrested for allegedly sneaking into a house and raping a vendor while she slept. Constable Onismo Kabone (42), under the Minerals and Border Control Unit, allegedly raped a 33-year-old woman (name withheld for ethical reasons) of Garikai Compound in Binga. A source said Kabone proposed love to the woman sometime in March this year. The woman suggested that they should first undergo HIV tests at Binga Hospital before she could seriously consider his proposal. “On that same day, Kabone allegedly followed the victim to her home. Later during the night, he sneaked into the woman’s bedroom while she was fast asleep and had sexual intercourse with her once, without her consent. “The victim woke up and lit her cellphone torch only to discover that it was the accused on top her. Kabone fled from the house and left his jacket and shoes,” said the source. The source said on the following day, the suspect went out of the district on work duties for about six weeks and upon his return, the woman approached him demanding to know why he had sex with her without her consent. “The two did not reach an understanding and the victim, who is a vendor at Binga Bus Terminus, made a report to the police on Monday and the suspect was arrested and is in police custody,” said the source. Matabeleland North police spokesperson Inspector Siphiwe Makonese could not comment on the matter yesterday. “I haven’t received a report of such nature, hence I can’t comment,” she said. @winnie_masara
