 Yemurai Ushamba, Chronicle Reporter A DEBT-RIDDEN teacher who is struggling to service his five salary-based loans and provide for his family has been banned by the court from accessing any loan facility for the next 14 months. Bulawayo magistrate Ms Sharon Rosemani ordered Trymore Shoko to desist from taking loans until May 2019 following an application for maintenance by his wife, Ms Bongani Zhou. Ms Zhou had approached the court seeking an order directing her husband to pay $187 for the upkeep of their son whose age was not stated in court papers. “I hereby order you to pay $20 for the upkeep of one minor child until finish paying your loans in October this year. From November 2018 you will pay $180 until your son is 18 or self-sufficient. You are also banned from taking any loans for 14 months,” she said. Shoko admitted that he was failing to take care of his family because he was getting a paltry $30, a remainder from his salary after loan deductions. He told the court that he took five loans which will cease to be deducted sometime in October 2018. “Your Worship, I took five loans to pay up a huge debt I had. I only get $30 after deductions. I will finish paying the loans in October this year. I promise to take care of my family and will fulfil that promise when the loans are repaid,” he said. Shoko’s wife said she was not aware of the loans that appeared on her husband’s payslip. “We have been married for three years and he doesn’t bring any money home. He is not honest with me, I am not aware of the loans and I did not benefit from them. I am requesting for $187 for the upkeep of my son,” she said. — @YUshamba
