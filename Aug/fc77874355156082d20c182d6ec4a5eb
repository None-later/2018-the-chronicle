 Yemurai Ushamba, Court Reporter A MAN from Bulawayo who was accused of kidnapping a three-year-old child and holding him for more than five hours was yesterday acquitted. Onias Dube (46) of Cowdray Park, a commuter omnibus driver who transports children to school, had dropped other children at their homes but failed to deliver the minor until 9PM. He had pleaded not guilty to kidnapping before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Stephen Ndlovu. Mr Ndlovu found Dube not guilty and discharged him. In acquitting Dube, Mr Ndlovu said he took into account that there was no one at the child’s house and that it would have been dangerous to leave the minor alone. “You played a parental role to the minor. You took him and stayed with him because there was no one at his house. If you had left the child what would have happened? You did not abuse him, you felt he was your responsibility and you got punished for that. It’s unfortunate you were punished for a good deed. You are free to go,” he said. The court heard that a missing person report was filed and investigations led to Dube’s arrest and the minor was found in his car.—@YUshamba.
