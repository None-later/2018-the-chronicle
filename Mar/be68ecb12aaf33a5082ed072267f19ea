Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter POOL clubs from the three Bulawayo Provincial Pool Associations’ leagues will battle it out at the frames at their respective Easter tournaments which start today and end on Monday. The province has three leagues — the topflight, Bulawayo Central District and the Mzilikazi District. Bulawayo Central and Mzilikazi Districts league will have their tournaments today and tomorrow, with the topflight holiday tournament to be played on Sunday and Monday. Fungai Nyandoro, the association’s marketing and publicity secretary said they decided to spread the games throughout the holidays to provide entertainment for the sport’s lovers. “It’ is going to be an exciting Easter weekend as  we have competitive games spread throughout the holiday across Bulawayo. Since each league has 16 teams, what we’ve done is to divide them into four groups. The top two teams in each group will then proceed to the final to be played on the second day. — @ZililoR.
