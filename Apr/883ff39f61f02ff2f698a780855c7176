Sports Reporter BULAWAYO-based former footballers will be the draw card at the inaugural Thandi Tshili sponsored six-team tournament which starts today and ends tomorrow at Bhekeni Line in Ntabazinduna. The organisers of the tournament have also invited Highlanders chairman, Kenneth Mhlophe, who hails from Ntabazinduna to be their guest of honour. Thembinkosi Ncube, a member of the tournament’s organising committee as well as Bhekeni Celtic secretary, said the stage is set for the competition which is meant to unveil the club to the community of Ntabazinduna. Newly formed Bhekeni Celtic who will compete in the Zifa Bulawayo Province Division Three League, will battle it out at the competition together with Super Eagles, Burning Spears, Flying, Best Football Club and Bulawayo Legends. “We’ve invited a team of former footballers who are based in Bulawayo so that they can come and interact with the boys as well as give words of encouragement to the participants. As most people from the area support Highlanders, we’ve also invited the club’s chairman to be the guest of honour. “The idea of this tournament is to parade Bhekeni Celtic to the community. “This tournament is more of a launch of our club and we’ve invited teams to come and have an exciting sporting weekend. Bhekeni Celtic has just affiliated with the Bulawayo’s Division Three and what we want is to have a buy-in from the community,” said Ncube. The Bulawayo former footballers’ side has among other yesteryear greats Ronald “Gidiza” Sibanda, Herbert Dick, Nkosana Gumbo, Johannes Ngodzo, Voster Chitemu, Mkhuphali Masuku and Sizalobuhle Dube.
