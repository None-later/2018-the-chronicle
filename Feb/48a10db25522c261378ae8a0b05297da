 Chronicle Reporter AUTHORITIES at Premier High School in Pumula suburb, Bulawayo, have said a teenager from their school who hanged himself last month died before collecting his Advanced Level results. Makhosi Mbano (19), from Northend suburb allegedly hanged himself at home while his family members were away. The school’s marketing and information manager Mr Joakim Chakanyuka yesterday said Makhosi died before collecting his results contrary to earlier reports that suggested that he committed suicide after collecting his results. “We want to set the record straight that Makhosi, who was our student committed suicide before collecting his results. The result slip is still at school,” said Mr Chakanyuka. The principal of the school, Mr McMillan Dube also confirmed that the deceased never collected his results. When the Chronicle news crew visited Makhosi’s family soon after his death last month, family members refused to comment on the alleged suicide. Their neighbours told Chronicle that Makhosi’s stepfather Mr Pieter Cloette found his body hanging in his room.
