 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO province have set their eyes on winning the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) inter-provincial track and field championships to be held this weekend at White City Stadium. The event will be held on Saturday and Sunday, with all provinces set to take part in what is expected to be a highly competitive contest. Bulawayo Athletics Board chairman Manuel Mpofu is confident the event will be successfully hosted, as it also serves as a qualifier for different international competitions. “The organising committee is running around to make sure that the event becomes a huge success. The Bulawayo team has been working very hard and as the hosts, we will be looking forward to dominate the event. We are going to have athletes in all the events and are confident going into this one,” said Mpofu Athletes will compete in track events, which include 100m and 200m as well as relays and middle distance events such as the 10 000m. In the field events, athletes will compete in discus, shot-put, javelin, hammer throw, high jump, long jump and triple jump. Naaz has its major focus on juniors, who have major competitions lined up for the year. They have the African Youth Games in Algeria in July and the Youth Olympic Games in Argentina, later in the same month. Naaz will be hoping it can attract more athletes in forthcoming events to create more competition as well as enhance the competitiveness of the locals when they go for qualifying events.
