Nation Dube Sikhumbuzo Moyo in Hwange A BLOOD and thunder affair is expected at Empumalanga suburb in Hwange when Makomo and Hwange lock horns in the Zifa Southern Region Division One League encounter at Nengasha Stadium tomorrow. The duel is all about bragging rights in a community that has been starved of Premiership football since Hwange were relegated from the topflight last season. Chipangano, under the guidance of Nation Dube and Brian Njobvu, go into tomorrow’s game topping the league table with 40 points, while Makomo are sixth with 27 points and still in with a mathematical chance of winning the sole ticket to the big boys’ league. “A derby is always tricky, but my boys are ready,” said Makomo head coach Tapela Ngwenya, who was given the reins after Rahman Gumbo abandoned ship and crossed the border to join South African National First Division side Witbank Spurs. Ngwenya reported a clean bill of health in his camp, setting the stage for an epic encounter. “We have no injuries or suspensions,” said Ngwenya. His boys have to summon all their courage, as Chipangano have their eyes firmly set on an early return to the Premiership and would certainly not want to be disturbed in their stride. With experienced players like Canaan Nkomo, the resurrected Malvern Longwe, former Highlanders skipper Felix Chindungwe and the ageless Gilbert Zulu, Hwange have the personnel to leave Nengasha Stadium with maximum points.
