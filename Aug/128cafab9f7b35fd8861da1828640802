Victor Kamhuka (right) Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Dynamos and How Mine gangly defender, Victor Kamhuka, has resurfaced in India where he is turning out for Path Chakra in the Calcutta Premier Division A League. The 28-year-old defender, who also played for South African outfit Black Leopards, becomes the third Zimbabwean in history to ply his trade in India after Simbarashe Gate and David Mkandawire. Kamhuka told Chronicle Sport from his Indian base that the level of football in India was better than Zimbabwe and attributed it to an influx of European coaches. “It’s an exciting league largely because of European coaches who are in charge of a number of clubs and I am enjoying my stay and my football,” said Kamhuka. He has already relocated his family to the populous nation. “It’s important to also note that India is ranked higher than Zimbabwe on the Fifa World rankings and that must show you that their game is naturally regarded higher and fast improving,” he said. According to the latest Fifa Coca-Cola World Rankings, India is ranked 97th in the world, while Zimbabwe is 118th. The 2018/19 Calcutta Premier Division A League season got underway at the beginning of this month and Kamhuka’s team has recorded one win and one loss in the two games played to date. They lost 0-1 to Mohun Bagan in the opening game of the season and beat Tolly Gunge 2-0 last weekend. Kamhuka has set his sights on a Warriors’ call-up for the forthcoming Total Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers that get underway next month.
