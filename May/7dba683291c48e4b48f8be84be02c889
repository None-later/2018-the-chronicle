Thandanani Women’s Ensemble Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent VETERAN traditional dance groups Thandanani Women’s Ensemble and Iluba Lemvelo are expected to lead a group of arts groups from Zimbabwe who are taking part at the Livingstone International Cultural Arts Festival – LICAF in Zambia. The four-day carnival that begins today will see the groups also travelling with Bambanani Arts Ensemble and Amakhosi Performing Arts Academy. Thandanani Women’s Ensemble spokesperson Yvette Ngwenya said they were excited to showcase Zimbabwean traditions at the festival. “We’re happy to have been afforded this opportunity to show off our skills in Livingstone. We’re ready as we’ve been gearing up for the event with numerous rehearsals,” said Ngwenya. LICAF is similar to the Harare International Carnival where there are street processions by various groups from across the continent and the host nation Zambia. The groups from Zimbabwe, according to head of delegation, Sinqobekuhle Latoa Ndlovu, were carefully selected to share Zimbabwean traditional dances.
