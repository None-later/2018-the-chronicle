ZIMBABWE men’s hockey team came second to Egypt, while the women’s side anchored its group in the Zapalala Series Hockey Open at Kumalo Hockey Stadium at the weekend. Namibia, Zambia, Egypt and Zimbabwe took part in the men’s event, while the women’s tourney had all the sides except Egypt. The Egypt men’s team, ranked 16th on the FIH Hero World Rankings, qualified for the Hockey Series Final taking place in France, while the women’s winners Namibia will either play the next stage in Spain or Ireland. The Zimbabwe men’s team, who are ranked 66th in the world, drew the opening match 3-3 with Zambia before losing 1-4 to Egypt and drawing 3-3 against Namibia in their final match. Apart from beating the hosts, the Egyptian men humiliated Namibia and Zambia 17-1 and 13-0 respectively. The Zimbabwe women’s team lost all its two matches; throwing away a 1-0 first half lead to fall 2-3 to Zambia, and 0-1 to Namibia. Local organising committee chairperson Ralpesh Parshotam said the visiting teams were happy with the facilities. “We’re grateful to Zapalala for partnering with us and making this a success. The games were played with a lot of spirit and exhibited great competition and utmost professionalism,” said Parshotam. “The event attracted a lot of attention from the people of Bulawayo and we appreciate that. The venue met the requirements of the tournament and we applaud everyone who played a part in ensuring this became a success.” — @DecoDecent2.
