Dr Thokozani Khuphe Nyemudzai Kakore, Harare Bureau THE MDC-T led by Dr Thokozani Khupe yesterday announced that it will field 112 candidates for parliamentary elections scheduled for July 30, and that it is ready to launch its campaign this weekend. Addressing the media in the capital yesterday, the party’s spokesperson Ms Linda Masarira said they failed to field 210 candidates as a result of harassment and intimidation of its candidates by the MDC Alliance. “The road has not been and is not that rosy because of the existence of many external challenges that shook the party, which has, however, remained firm,” she said. “Zec failed to avail the voters’ roll before nomination court day and we endured perpetual verbal and physical abuse from other political parties, in particular the MDC Alliance. “However, this has not affected our political vision and ambition as we have managed to mobilise and have a stable political party in a short period after our congress in April and managed to field 110 candidates for the National Assembly elections, which is about 52,8 percent of the total of 210.” Ms Masarira dismissed claims that their party was re-uniting with the MDC Alliance, saying they did not have such intentions as they were the real MDC-T. She said Dr Khupe was the best candidate to move Zimbabwe forward as a result of the party’s manifesto, which she said was “realistic”. “Any overtures by our erstwhile comrades will not yield any success as we are now focusing on campaigning than anything else,” said Ms Masarira. “President Dr Khupe remains the true and real leader of the party. “Our manifesto is the best manifesto as it is articulating the challenges that the nation is facing and giving realistic solutions and promises to the basic needs of Zimbabweans.”
