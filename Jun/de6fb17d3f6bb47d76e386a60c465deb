 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter MATABELELAND South province will host the national schools baseball tournament at Gwanda High School from July 4-7. Over 40 schools are expected to converge in Gwanda for the baseball fiesta that will see future national team players showcasing their talent. Each province is expected to enter four teams for the tournament, of which two will participate in the Under-16 category, while the other two will contest in the Under-20 category. National baseball team coach Washington Nyika said: “We are excited about this tournament. This is an opportunity to scout for young talent and make sure we groom our future players. The country has vast potential to become a powerhouse on the continent, but we are let down by the failure to play competitive games on a regular basis. Zimbabwe doesn’t have a functional national baseball league and this has forced the few teams to form city leagues to play friendlies. The major let down for baseball in the country is a lack of serious competition.” He said Zimbabwe needed national standard equipment and the fact that the national team plays in the B League of the South African NBC League instead of the highly rated A League, speaks volumes of how far behind Zimbabwe baseball is. The national baseball team is preparing for an Olympic qualifier whose date and venue is yet to be announced. @innocentskizoe
