Lovemore Zigara in Gweru ZIMBABWE General Medical Aid Fund Central Region Soccer League sides, Ivan Hoe and ZPC Munyati have fired their coaches Julius Chakupewa and Isaac Nyabvure respectively over poor results. The relieving of duty of the coaches comes despite the league being at its infancy stage and that the two clubs were not far off from the early pacesetters Whawha who are on 14 points. ZPC Munyati lie sixth on the table with 10 points while Ivan Hoe are 10th  in the 12 team league with seven points but have a game in hand. Ivan Hoe treasurer Itai Munyanyi confirmed the firing of Chakupewa saying he had failed to meet the targets the club had given him. “We gave him three games to collect nine points and he failed to meet that target and we have relieved him of his duties,” said Munyanyi. ZPC Munyati officials could not be reached for comment as they were not picking up their phones. Nyabvure confirmed that he had indeed been sacked by the power generators. Sources at the power generators said TelOne coach Joel Luphahla was the favourite to land the job which has been left vacant by the former Lancashire Steel midfielder. However, Luphahla refuted the claims. “I am still at TelOne my brother. I want to finish the project that I started here and I am not going anywhere,” he said.
