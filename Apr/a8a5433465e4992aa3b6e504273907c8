 Nyaradzo Bakari, Chronicle Reporter TWO men from Inyathi have appeared in court for allegedly stealing cattle worth more than $13 000 from their employer. Langelihle Dlamini (35) and Samuel Khumalo (54) allegedly connived to steal cattle worth $13 800 from Mr Aaron Tshabangu between 2011 and 2016. A court heard that Dlamini was the caretaker at Inyathi co-operative farm while Khumalo was employed as a dip attendant. The two are said to have understated figures in Mr Tshabangu’s stock record books and stole cattle that were not recorded. They pleaded not guilty to four counts of stock theft before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Franklin Mkhwananzi. Dlamini and Khumalo were released on $300 bail each and Mr Mkhwananzi remanded the matter to Wednesday. Prosecuting, Mr Mclean Ndlovu said the duo stole 23 beasts from Mr Tshabangu between August 2011 and August 2016. “Between August 2011 and August 2016, the two accused persons connived to steal from the complainant. They understated figures in the stock card register. The accused persons committed the offence in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2016. The complainant lost a total of 23 cattle as a result of the offence,” he said.—@NyarieBakie
