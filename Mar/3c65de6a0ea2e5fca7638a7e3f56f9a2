 Thandiwe Katinhimure, Business Reporter ZIMBABWE’s largest banking group, CBZ Holdings, will this month host the second edition of the CBZ International Small to Medium Enterprise (SME) Indaba at the ZITF grounds in Bulawayo. CBZ Bank has been at the forefront of supporting the growth of the SMEs sector and has won awards for supporting budding businesses. “After the phenomenal success of the inaugural event, CBZ Holdings will be hosting the second edition of the CBZ International SME Indaba under the theme “Enhancing SME Growth through Smart Partnerships” from the 21st to the 23rd of March 2018 at the ZITF Grounds Hall 4 in Bulawayo,” CBZ said in a statement. The firm said the gathering would bring together local, regional and international stakeholders, business leaders, national and international experts relevant to the growth of the SMEs sector. “It will provide a unique platform dedicated to creating awareness of the challenges faced by SMEs and provide solutions to the challenges highlighted through presentations and discussions with both local and international experts,” it said. SMEs face numerous challenges related to financial constraints, limited strategic thinking, lack of access to relevant markets, lower standardisation and in some instances a weak legal and regulatory structure. However, CBZ said SMEs have major strengths that include flexibility and the ability to adapt to market changes, more customer focus, high visible top management, low bureaucracy, informal working environment, innovativeness and quick response to seize opportunities among others. “SMEs play a key role in economic growth and development in many countries around the world and they have become a dominant form of business venture in many developing economies and contribute to exports, employment generation, economic empowerment and poverty alleviation,” said CBZ. It said the event would seek to increase the global spotlight on Zimbabwe’s SMEs and highlight opportunities for growth and the type of support available to them. — @thandyfeminine
