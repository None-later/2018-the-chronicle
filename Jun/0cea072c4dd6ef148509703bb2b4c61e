Takesure Chiragwi Lovemore Zigara in Gweru ZVISHAVANE-based Castle Lager Premiership side Shabanie Mine has bolstered its technical team by adding four new faces as the club seeks to avoid relegation. Shabanie Mine are third from bottom of the league table with 12 points and have won only one game. Takesure Chiragwi remains head coach, while former head coach Elvis Muuya has been brought back as team manager. Former Black Rhinos and Shabanie Mine midfielder Rowan Nenzou and Gerald Phiri have also been brought into the fold as technical advisors. Club secretary Max Nyashanu confirmed the developments and hoped these additions will help the team to start surfing away from the relegation waters. “I can confirm that we have made new additions to the technical team, with Alexio Sijioni coming in as assistant coach. For those that watched the Zvishavane derby when we played against FC Platinum, Sijioni was already on the bench,” said Nyashanu. “We have also roped in Elvis Muuya as team manager while Rowan Nenzou and Gerald Phiri are technical advisors. These men bring a wealth of experience on and off the pitch and we believe as a club that they will help us achieve our goal of remaining in the Premiership,” he said. The developments puts to rest speculation about Chiragwi’s future, whose head many club faithful have been calling for. Tendai Chikuni, who guided the Chinda Boys back to the Premiership in 2016, had been touted to take over. However, Chikuni dismissed the rumours and is now linked to a team in the Zifa Central Division One league, but is yet to finalise the deal. — @lavuzigara1
