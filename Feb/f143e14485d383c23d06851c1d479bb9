 Showbiz Reporter HIGH school pupilss have until March 1 to enter the 2017 edition of the DStv Eutelsat Star Awards competition as the closing date for entries has been extended due to popular demand. MultiChoice Zimbabwe spokesperson, Liz Dziva, said science and technology fans between the ages of 14 and 19 now have extra time to be inspired to write a creative essay or design a poster. “This year’s topic is ‘It’s sixty years since the first satellite, Sputnik, was launched, broadcasting a unique and easily captured ‘beep, beep, beep’ signal’. Looking back at this historic moment, students are expected to write an essay or design a poster depicting how satellites have launched humankind into the 21st century and acted as a unifier,” Dziva explained. The essay winner will be eligible for a trip for two to Paris, France in the company of Eutelsat and onwards to French Guiana to see a rocket launch into space. The poster winner will win a trip for two to South Africa which includes a visit to the South African National Space Agency as well as exploration of several heritage sites as guests of MultiChoice Africa. “The schools attended by the two winners will also receive a DStv installation, including a dish, TV, decoder and free access to the DStv Education Package,” Dziva said. The DStv Eutelsat Star Awards competition is open to all learners from secondary (high) or combined schools. Entry forms can be obtained from any MultiChoice office or via the www.dstvstarawards.com  website. “Entries are accepted in English, French and Portuguese and will be judged on the basis of high-standard criteria of accuracy, creativity, originality and innovation. For the first time this year students are also invited to engage with the awards community through a dedicated Facebook page.” The competition closes on March 1 with the overall winners set to be announced at an awards ceremony to be held in April.
