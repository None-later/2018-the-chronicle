 Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent ZIMBABWEAN rappers will next month take on Namibian rappers during the Grape Vine rap battles as the platform to nurture up-and-coming hip hop artistes spreads its wings regionally. The rap battles, which pit wordsmiths together, are where award-winning rapper ASAPH carved his career. They are a platform where hip hop artistes go toe to toe, free styling on the mic to see who the best wordsmith is. On September 1, the rap battles will play host to Namibian MCs at YWCA (Opposite Convent School) in Bulawayo. The Namibians will showcase alongside Zimbabwe’s Jilly Tha Black and Luminous. These two were selected to represent Zimbabwe after last month’s local rap battles. Organiser of the rap battle Naboth ‘Rizzla’ Ramayi said: “The collaboration is part of an idea to have more cross country battles to foster a SADC Rap Battle League. Plans are already at an advanced stage to engage the Botswana and Lesotho Rap League in the near future.” He said he hoped that this would help grow the hip hop culture in the region. “We hope this will grow the Hip Hop Culture beyond borders for both countries. The return leg in Namibia will be organised soon after as we’re still looking for sponsors to help support this endeavour,” said Rizzla.
