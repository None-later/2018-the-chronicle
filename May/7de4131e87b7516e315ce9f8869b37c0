Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter PROMISING Highlanders’ right-back Bukhosi Ncube is on the road to full recovery and will soon return to action. Ncube has been battling a knee injury sustained at training more than a month ago. Coach Madinda Ndlovu revealed that Ncube had started doing some light training, adding that his presence would give Bosso good options. Before the injury, Ncube gave the Bosso bench good options, as they would push Mclive Phiri upfront to add more firepower. While Phiri has been overlapping, he has been cautious not to move forward frequently, leaving open pockets for the opposition, especially when Highlanders lose possession. They were heavily punished by Ngezi Platinum Stars at Baobab Stadium as a result of Phiri overlapping and leaving a yawning gap. While Ncube is on the road to recovery, midfielder Nigel Makumbe has not been that lucky and now has a plaster on his ankle. Makumbe has been out of action for more than a month and seemed to have recovered ahead of the trip to Yadah in Harare only to aggravate the injury. “The doctors have since put a plaster to monitor his ankle, so he will be out for a while now. We just hope his recovery will be quick,” said Ndlovu.
