 Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIFA Southern Region Division One side Talen Vision’s executive is holding a two-day football management induction workshop being conducted by former Zifa education officer Brian Moyo to apprise them on the latest trends in the game’s management and statutes. The workshop started in Bulawayo yesterday. “We realised that some of the newly appointed members of the executive might not be articulate in football management hence this workshop. We want all of us to pull in one direction and with one objective,” said Talen Vision chief executive officer Juma Phiri. The executive committee is headed by chairman Mishon Tsabalaka, who is deputised by Sabelo Mpofu with Mthokozisi Langa as secretary-general. Thembelihle Nkomo handles the club’s finances, while Methembe Nkomo and Jason Sibanda are the two committee members. Khumbulani Nkomo is the club president with Qiniso Dube as his deputy. Long serving football administrator Otrick Siziba is the team’s patron. The Bulawayo-based outfit has already made known its intentions of qualifying for the sole Premiership ticket at the end of the 2018 season and is leaving no stone unturned in its preparations, both on the administrative side and technical aspect of the game. The technical department will be headed by Slovakian national Miroslav Nemec (63) and assisted by Saul Ndlovu, while veteran goalkeepers’ coach Johannes Tshuma will look after the goal minders. Owen Butete, Xolani Nkundlande and Scouter Makhosi Mbeba will be in charge of the juniors, with Wellington Nyathi as acting team manager and Kuda Mutandavari heading the medical department. Last week, Phiri revealed that they had acquired the services of three Nigerian players and the same number from relegated Bantu Rovers, underlining their intentions of a maiden Premiership appearance. The identity of the new recruits will be revealed soon ahead of the 2018 season kick-off. @skhumoyo2000
