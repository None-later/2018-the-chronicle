 Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief A 27-year-old Masters Degree student at Midlands State University (MSU) was on Tuesday stabbed to death by his 31-year-old brother suspected to be mentally challenged. Acting Midlands provincial police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Ethel Mukwende confirmed the murder of Brian Konzo who was studying towards a Master of Science Degree in Community Psychology. His older brother’s name was withheld since it is not yet clear if he is indeed a mental patient. “Police in Redcliff are investigating the murder of Brian Konzo who is alleged to have been stabbed to death by his brother suspected to be a mental patient,” said Asst Insp Mukwende. She said the deceased’s mother, Mrs Prisca Konzo, left  the suspect and the deceased home to visit the nearby Kwekwe town. “On Tuesday at around 9AM, Mrs Konzo who is the mother to the two brothers left home to visit Kwekwe town. It is alleged that while she was away, the suspect called her and told her that Brian had been killed. “The matter was reported to the police and the scene was attended. The police found Brian’s body in the house with multiple stab wounds before it was conveyed to Kwekwe General Hospital where it is awaiting postmortem,” she said. Asst Insp Mukwende said police investigations led to the arrest of Konzo’s brother. “Police are appealing to members of the public to constantly monitor the behaviour of their relatives that are mentally challenged,” she said.
