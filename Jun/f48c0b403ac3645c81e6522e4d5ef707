Enock Ikope Bongani Ndlovu, Sports Correspondent THE International Cricket Council (ICC) have charged Zimbabwe Cricket director Enock Ikope with three counts of breaching the ICC Anti-Corruption Code and subsequently suspended him with immediate effect  according to a statement by the international cricket governing body yesterday. Ikope is a ZC director and chairman of the Harare Metropolitan Cricket Association that runs league cricket in Harare and oversees the domestic franchise, Mashonaland Eagles. ICC general manager for strategic communications Claire Furlong said Ikope had been provisionally suspended with immediate effect. “Mr Ikope has been charged with the following three offences under the Code Article 2.4.6 – failure or refusal, without compelling justification, to cooperate with an investigation being carried out by the ACU in relation to possible corrupt conduct under the Code. Article 2.4.7 – delaying an investigation being carried out by the ACU in relation to possible corrupt conduct under the Code. Article 2.4.7– obstruction of an investigation being carried out by the ACU in relation to possible corrupt conduct under the Code,” said Furlong. She said Ikope has 14 days from yesterday to respond to the charges. “The ICC will not make any further comment in respect of these charges at this stage,” Furlong said. This latest suspension comes three months after another member of the Harare Metropolitan Cricket Association board Rajan Nayer was banned from holding any position within cricket for 20 years by the ICC in March. Nayer was banned after being found guilty on charges of fixing international games. It is highly likely that Ikope’s charges stem from the same case after former Zimbabwe senior national team skipper Graeme Cremer informed former Chevrons coach Heath Streak of an alleged approach by an official to influence the result of the Zimbabwe and West Indies Test series in 2017. The matter was immediately reported to the ICC.
