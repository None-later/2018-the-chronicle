 Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter A NEW state-of-the-art music studio has been set up in Gwanda and is poised to be a solution to the lack of quality music in  Matabeleland South province. The studio named PM Studios is owned by Prophet Tatenda Makasi of Destiny Encounter Ministries and is open to all artistes. “The studio has a state-of-the-art sound system with the latest recording machines as well as a recording booth. Through this studio, we’re confident our artistes will now be able to produce quality music,” Prophet Makasi said. He said he set up the studio to assist up-and-coming artistes realise their goals. “There’s a lot of talent that needs to be nurtured here. I believe this is a calling from God to give young artistes an opportunity to explore their talents. “Hopefully, the studio will nurture a lot of untapped talent and develop their careers.” The studio is expected to be launched on March 31 at the Red Cross Hall with established artistes drawn from different parts of the country set to perform. So far, the newly opened studio has managed to record a hip-hop track for a Bulawayo-based author and motivational speaker Marshall Chiza who recently ventured into music. The song titled, l’m a Billionaire, is already being played by local radio stations in Bulawayo. The prophet invited artistes from all over the country to visit the studio and record their works there. “The recording fees are low as the studio is meant to cater for up-and-coming artistes from small towns.” Gwanda-based producers Drumz and Lance Hebron said the studio was a welcome development as it will help a lot of artistes they have worked with in the past to finally record their works. @mthabisi_mthire
