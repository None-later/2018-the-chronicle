Dr Nyasha Masuka Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent MATABELELAND North Provincial Medical Director Dr Nyasha Masuka has urged Government to incentivise doctors working in rural areas or remote areas to retain the medical practitioners. Dr Masuka made the plea during a provincial development committee meeting which was attended by the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs Matabeleland North Cde Cain Mathema in Bulawayo on Wednesday. He noted that most of the doctors working in remote areas do so while waiting to get jobs in urban areas. In an interview yesterday, Dr Masuka said as it stands there is nothing to motivate doctors to remain in rural areas. He said shortage of doctors was straining hospitals in Matabeleland North. “I was saying that the Government should incentivise them through providing them with commercial stands or farm lands so that they can generate extra income through a private enterprise. The reason why they leave is because they can’t make much money as other doctors in urban set ups,” he said. Dr Masuka said the poor working environment has resulted in doctors shunning rural areas with Matabeleland North having a shortage of medical practitioners. – @nqotshili.
