 Codelia Mondela, Court Reporter A WOMAN from Bulawayo has been arrested for physically abusing her four-year-old niece. The woman (33) from Makokoba suburb, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the minor, allegedly assaulted the child with a cellphone charger cord each time she soiled herself. Last week, a police officer stationed at Mzilikazi Police Station received a tip-off through a Whatsapp message that the woman was abusing her niece. The woman was not asked to plead to ill-treatment of a child when she appeared on Friday last week before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Adelaide Mbeure. The magistrate granted her $100 bail and remanded the matter to Friday. For the State, Mr Tawurai Hondoyemoto alleged that on Friday two weeks ago, Constable Shumbairerwa received an anonymous tip-off informing him that the child was being physically abused by her aunt. “Upon taking action on the tip-off, the child was found to be having visible injuries all over the body. The minor was interviewed and she stated that her aunt assaulted her with a cellphone charger whenever she messed her panties,” he said. @MondelaC
