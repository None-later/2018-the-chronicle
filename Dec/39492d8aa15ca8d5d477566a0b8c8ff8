INDUSTRY and Commerce Deputy Minister Raj Modi has engaged Varun Beverages to make special arrangements to ensure the country has enough soft drinks during the festive season. Varun Beverages, which is headquartered in India, is a subsidiary of global player RJ Corp and produces Pepsi products, among other beverages like Miranda and Mountain Dew. The special arrangement, he said, came after Delta Beverages, which is the country’s biggest beverages manufacturer, indicated that there would be no soft drinks in the market during the festive season due to foreign currency shortages to import critical raw materials. “In response to Delta few days ago that there will be no soft drinks during the festive season, I approached Pepsi chairman (Mr Ravi Jaipuria) who was here (Zimbabwe) recently from India. “I held serious discussions with him and requested that since they have a plant here, could he do something about the challenge we are facing in Zimbabwe on availability of soft drinks during the festive season,” said Deputy Minister Modi.“He has indicated to me that he will do something so he has promised to give 200 000 cases of soft drinks for Bulawayo region and the drinks will be distributed through a chain of distribution channels.”. — @okazunga.
