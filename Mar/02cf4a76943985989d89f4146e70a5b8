Dereck Chisora LONDON — Carlos Takam is holding negotiations about a possible fight with Zimbabwe-born heavyweight boxer Dereck Chisora, according to his promoter Christian Cherchi. The France-based Cameroonian could fight again in Britain this year after his brave stoppage defeat to Anthony Joshua in Cardiff last October as Cherchi hopes to agree a deal with Matchroom Boxing boss Eddie Hearn for Takam to take on Chisora in May. Chisora has been out of the ring since a points loss to European champion Agit Kabayel in November and could not agree terms for a discussed fight with fellow Brit Joe Joyce. “At the Okolie-Chamberlain fight, I proposed this fight,” Cherchi told Sky Sports. “He likes the deal. Now it’s only speaking about the money and see if everybody is on board. “If Chisora wants the fight, I don’t think he will have a problem doing the fight. “I will definitely speak with (Hearn) this week.” Asked when the fight could be finalised, Cherchi added: “End of the month, for sure.” Takam shared a brutal battle with Joshua before referee Phil Edwards halted the fight in the 10th round and has welcomed the opportunity to fight Chisora. “Yeah, I’m very excited,” said Takam. “My first time here was a very good experience. “Yes, Chisora is a good fighter. The guy is not easy to fight. He is more crazy, but a good guy. I’m very calm, he is very crazy. “It’s going to be an exciting fight for me.” — Sky Sport
