President Mnangagwa Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa’s visionary leadership will lead to empowerment of the youth and a turnaround of the sports industry through the establishment of state-of-the-art multipurpose sports facilities countrywide. This was said by the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation in its congratulatory message to the President following his inauguration as the country’s second Executive President. “As a ministry, we indeed cherish your vision and leadership towards empowerment of the youth, turning around the performance of the sports and arts industries through creation of Empower Bank and establishment of state-of-the-art multipurpose sports and arts facilities respectively, thereby creating massive employment opportunities. As per your expectations as alluded to in your inauguration speech, we will indeed deliver quality and timely services to the people of Zimbabwe with pride,” said the ministry in its message. “We commit ourselves to diligently execute the policies and programmes for the benefit of our new Zimbabwe.” President Mnangagwa is known for his soft spot for sports, having been patron of many organisations before; notably the Heath Streak Cricket Academy as well as reigning Castle Lager Premier Soccer League champions FC Platinum.
