 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter LACK of regular competitive action is the Achilles’ heel to the growth and development of baseball in the country according to national team coach Washington Nyika. Nyika said this has caused a slow death of the game. Speaking at the Giants Cup Series that Harare province won 2-1 at Hamilton High School at the weekend, Nyika said the country had vast potential and ability to be a powerhouse on the continent. “Zimbabwe doesn’t have a functional national baseball league and this has forced the few teams to form city leagues to play friendlies. The major let down for baseball in the country is the lack of serious competition. We need other provinces besides Bulawayo and Harare to have teams playing baseball at national level if we are to grow the sport. Most of our players are still young, meaning they still have a lot of playing years ahead of them. We are appealing to the corporate world to assist financially,” said Nyika. He also said there was a need for the country to invest in high performance centres. “In South Africa they play elite baseball, which is what we as Zimbabwe should aim at achieving. After being accorded a chance to play in South Africa, I have realised that we are still far behind in terms of developing the game. Our playing conditions as a national team cannot even match those of their colleges. Their clubs use international stuff from their bats, gloves, coaches and the pitch.” The national baseball team is preparing for an Olympic qualifier whose date and venue is yet to be announced. – @innocentskizoe
