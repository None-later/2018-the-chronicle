I was very pleased by Zimbabweans for their patience in long queues at polling stations due to the large number of voters that registered to vote. My appeal to you all is to remain peaceful and not be impatient or listen to enemies of the State and cause disturbances as what happened in Harare yesterday. We must all remember that this is our country together. We don’t have any other. Don’t be fooled, if you go to any other you will remain a foreigner there and might be ill-treated because you will be a second citizen. — LK Let me commend every Zimbabwean with their wide and varied political leadership for having conducted the harmonised elections in a peaceful manner. This speaks volumes of our political maturity as a nation. I would like to thank Zec for conducting a peaceful election. My misgivings though are with the MDC Alliance which threatened to unleash violence after the elections, which obviously they lost presumably because of their attempt to rope in the unpopular former president Mr Robert Mugabe and his wife Grace. Thank you once again Zimbabwe. — Mula, Bulawayo Please alert the nation. There is a guy pretending to be a DSTV agent cheating people of their hard earned cash.  You pay for the service but you are not connected.  Help fellow Zimbabweans. — Concerned
