 Sports Reporter THE Bulawayo Metropolitan Province Darts League will hold an elective annual general meeting on Wednesday at Bellevue Sports Club. The 11 league teams will elect a new executive, whose immediate mandate is to plan for the new season and possibly work on ways of expanding the league. The league currently comprises champions Railstars, Bosso, Archers, Parkview Lions, School of Mines, Support Unit, Queens Sports Club, Khami, Parkview Khanka, How Mine and Bellevue. The league’s organising secretary Malcom Motta said outgoing members of the executive will not be contesting in the elections. “Everything is set for our annual general meeting which will be held on Wednesday at Bellevue Sports Club. The major item on the agenda is the election. As far as I know, members of the present executive will not contest as they want to have new guys coming in with fresh ideas. A new executive will be voted into office and they will be in charge of the affairs of the league for two years. It is only after the ushering in of a new executive that we will have the date for the season’s kick-off and other activities for the year,” said Motta. The outgoing BMPDL executive includes chairman Nhlanhla Thwala, who will present his report on Wednesday. He was deputised by Dan Mlambo, who did not finish his term and was not replaced. Julius Ncube is the outgoing secretary, while Milton Matiza holds the treasurer’s portfolio. Motta, Josephine James, Godfrey Mazonde and Tinashe Mashindi complete the executive.
