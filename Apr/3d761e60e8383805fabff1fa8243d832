 Sylvester Chiramba, Court Reporter A MAN from Bulawayo is battling for life in hospital after he sustained severe head injuries when he was assaulted by his neighbour over a $50 debt. Godi Nyathi (47) of Nketa 7 suburb allegedly assaulted his neighbour Mr David Dube (27) with fists and hit him with a stone several times on the head last Friday. The attack was allegedly triggered by Nyathi’s failure to pay $50 that he had borrowed from his neighbour. Mr Dube sustained severe head injuries and was admitted at Mpilo Central Hospital. Nyathi was not asked to plead to attempted murder when he appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Stephen Ndhlovu. Mr Ndhlovu remanded him in custody to April 16 pending the availing of a medical report. The magistrate also advised him to apply for bail at the High Court.— @SlyCee10
