 Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter ALL is now set for the Matabeleland North National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) inter-district track and field athletics finals at Tsholotsho and Mavela High schools tomorrow and Friday. The seven district teams are, however, expected to arrive in Tsholotsho this afternoon in time for the vetting process and technical meeting thereafter. Both the vetting and technical meeting will be done at Tsholotsho High School. “We are good to go. Teams are expected to be at Tsholotsho High School by 3pm tomorrow (today) in time for vetting and the technical meeting, which has been set for 4pm, so that by Thursday morning we don’t have any hindrance but get on with our programme,” said Matabeleland North Nash provincial chairperson Bonakele Ncube, the head of John Tallach High School. He said they had been to Tsholotsho and Mavela High schools and are satisfied with their state despite rain fears. “Barring any unforeseen disruptions, we expect to get underway by 7.30am on Thursday,” said Ncube. Matabeleland North has seven districts — Hwange, Binga, Lupane, Nkayi, Umguza, Bubi and Tsholotsho. This week’s meet will be used to select a provincial team for the national finals set for White City Stadium in Bulawayo later this month. Last year’s event was held at Nkayi High School in Nkayi district and Binga emerged tops. @skhumoyo2000
