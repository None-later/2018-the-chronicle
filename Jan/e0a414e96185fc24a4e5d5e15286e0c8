DJ Shimza Showbiz Correspondent IT’S been three years since DJ Shimza held his debut show in Bulawayo and the SA mix master returns to the city this time at Club Connect early next month as the nightspot welcomes back Nust students from semester break. The last time DJ Shimza was in Bulawayo, he performed at Club Eden and the show was epic. This time DJ Shimza’s performance will coincide with the Nust second semester commencement on February 2. He will be supported by DJs Kead Wikead, Zet, Mellow Drum and St Willz. Entrance to the show has been pegged at $10 general, $20 golden circle and $30 VVIP. Club Connect proprietor Biggie Chinoperekwei said: “We were approached by the Nust SRC to hold a party for them as they return to university from the long holiday. So we decided to bring Shimza to help them celebrate their return to varsity,” said Chinoperekwei. He said entrance for Nust students would be provided at the university through their SRC. “They’ve special tickets for students that are half price. The administration of those tickets will be done by the Nust SRC but at the door the prices remain unchanged,” said Chinoperekwei. Club Connect was one of the busiest nightspots last year as it hosted the hottest SA acts such as Zodwa Wabantu, Distruction Boyz and DJ Tira. Chinoperekwei said this show marked the beginning of quality entertainment that Club Connect was known for. “We pride ourselves as Club Connect in giving Bulawayo quality entertainment. After a long festive period DJ Shimza’s show marks the beginning of people having the time of their lives at the nightspot on that day and throughout the year,” said Chinoperekwei.
