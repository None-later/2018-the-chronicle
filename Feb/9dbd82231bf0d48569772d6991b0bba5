Ernest ‘Maphepha’ Sibanda Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Highlanders’ chairmen Themba Ndlela and Ernest “Maphepha” Sibanda have congratulated the Bulawayo giants’ new supremo Kenneth Mhlophe, who assumed the post unopposed on Sunday. Mhlophe went into the race alone following the disqualification of Sibanda. Barring any change to the club’s constitution, Mhlophe will be at Bosso’s helm for the next three years. Sibanda said the election season was over and it was now time to rally behind the new boss for the benefit of the club. “Congratulations, we have finished our elections and it’s time for us all to unite and support our new executive. When it falls, all of us fall because in Highlanders we are one. All the best, ‘Bosso for life’,” said Sibanda. In the same vein, Ndlela, who took over the club chairmanship from Sibanda in 2009, called on Mhlophe to unite the Highlanders’ family by embracing everyone. Reacting to a Facebook post by Mhlophe which read: “Great things about to happen kuqembu abanye lokhe besilwa lizatshiywa yisitimela, watch this space for good things,” Ndlela said it was the duty of Mhlophe to bring everyone into the train. “It’s your role Mr Chairman to get them into the train than leave them behind,” said Ndlela. Mhlophe was confirmed the new boss on Sunday, the same day Israel Moyo and Wisdom Mabhena were voted into office as secretary-general and committee member respectively. Moyo polled 105 votes compared to Siphatho Ncube’s 60 and Nkululeko Ndlovu’s 15. In the race for the committee member’s post, Mabhena received 87 votes to win another mandate in office, while Victoria Falls-based Silandulo Sibanda got a commendable 39, with Peacot Hadebe, who is the Heart and Soul Supporters’ Association chairman, getting 35 and former committee member Charles Moyo (18). @skhumoyo2000
