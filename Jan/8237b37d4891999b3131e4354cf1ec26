Joseph Muchechetere Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) is in the final stages of appointing an independent disciplinary committee to deal with 18 errant National Sports Associations (NSAs) that have failed to comply with Section 30 of the SRC Act. Once the disciplinary committee is in place, hearings will follow amid indications that a number of NSAs face deregistration for their failure to be compliant. “We are finalising appointment of the independent disciplinary committee. Once done, hearings will soon follow,” said SRC acting director-general Joseph Muchechetere. Part of Section 30 of the SRC Act reads: “Where the board considers that any registered national association; (a) has ceased to operate as a national association; or (b) has failed to comply with any provision of this Act; or (c) has conducted itself in a manner which is contrary to the national interest; the board may, after affording the association concerned an opportunity of making representations in the matter, do either or both of the following – (i) suspend all or any of its officers; (ii) direct the director-general to strike the association from the register. Below are the 18 sports associations that have failed on numerous occasions to regularise their positions in terms of the Act.
