 Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Gwanda Correspondent GOVERNMENT has distributed 641 heifers to farmers in Matabeleland South as part of the Command Livestock programme that was launched by President Mnangagwa in the province recently. President Mnangagwa handed over 1 660 heifers to beneficiaries from Matabeleland South’s seven districts when he launched the programme last month. Speaking at the handover of the heifers at the Gwanda Showgrounds on Wednesday, the Minister of State for Matabeleland South Provincial Affairs, Cde Abednico Ncube, urged farmers to maximise production. “Matabeleland South Province has a great potential of livestock production which remains untapped. You will recall that we used to export beef that was produced in West Nicholson. We are grateful for the continuous support that Government extends to us as a province. “The Command Agriculture programme will help boost livestock production. We applaud President Mnangagwa for putting in place projects that will undoubtedly improve the agricultural sector,” he said. Speaking at the same event, Matabeleland South Provincial crop and livestock officer, Ms Simangaliphi Ngwabi, said more heifers were expected to be delivered to the province as the programme was ongoing. “Today we are distributing 641 heifers to farmers in the province. As a province we have 8 159 farmers that have registered under the programme and more are set to receive heifers as the programme goes on. The appeal we have is for government to include bulls in the distribution exercise so that we can improve the breeding process. “Some farmers within the province are complaining that the vulnerable are not benefitting from this programme but they have to realise that this programme is meant to boost cattle production within the province. Beneficiaries are established farmers who have the capacity to breed these cattle until they multiply in numbers and then pay back the money” said Ms Ngwabi.—@DubeMatutu
