 Walter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent The Zimbabwe Congress of Students’ Unions (Zicosu) has pledged to mobilise full support for President Mnangagwa so that it leads the ruling Zanu-PF party to a crushing victory in the harmonised elections slated for July 30. Speaking during a public lecture organised by Zicosu at Masvingo Polytechnic last week, the students body’s secretary general Mr Tapiwa Marongere assured the Zanu-PF leadership of overwhelming support from students in Masvingo and the whole country in the coming elections. He said the majority of college students were solidly behind the leadership of President Mnangagwa and wanted him to continue his thrust of a new economic order and better education policies in Zimbabwe. “These students here are behind Zanu-PF and its leader President ED. We have travelled the length and breadth of the country mobilising support for our President and we covered a lot of ground. We therefore assure President Mnangagwa that we are solidly behind his leadership and victory is certain,” he said. Mr Marongere said students were grateful to President Mnangagwa for his efforts to address the plight of students as evidenced by a directive to for state colleges and universities to slash fees for students on work-related learning. “We hail our President for his bravery to stand up for the truth which also made him to ascend to the presidency against the evil wishes of the G40 cabal. “Students are fully behind President ED and we are aware of the persecution that he went through before he was able to spearhead the new dispensation in our country. We are really grateful to our President and we look up to him as our father,” he said.
