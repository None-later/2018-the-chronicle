ZANU-PF Bulawayo Province has urged all MPs to start fulfilling promises they made during the election campaigning period. The province said it is also the duty of the electorate to hold politicians accountable for the betterment of the societies. Speaking while donating to people living with disabilities and the elderly in Nketa suburb yesterday, Zanu-PF Bulawayo Provincial Secretary for Administration Cde Elphas Mashaba said the people who were elected during the 2018 harmonised election should prioritise delivering what they promised the electorate. He donated footwear to hundreds of the elderly and their grandchildren and to people living with disabilities. “The campaign period came and passed. Now it is the time to fulfil whatever they promised us. If they are slow, we the people have the capacity to hold them accountable. We are tired of all talk no action. We now want the results,” he said. Cde Mashaba urged all politicians to be in solidarity with President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s call for servant leadership. “Our President is on record calling for all leaders from all political parties to put the electorate first, ahead of their personal desires. I therefore urge them to walk in the vision of our leader,” he said. Cde Mashaba said yesterday’s donation was part of the promises he made during campaigning, although he lost the seat to Mr Phelela Masuku of the MDC. Beneficiaries of his gesture received the gifts with smiles all over their faces and thanked Cde Mashaba and the ruling party for the Christmas presents. —@esinathy_essira
