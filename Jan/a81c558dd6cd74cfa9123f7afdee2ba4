 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Bulawayo Basketball Association (BBA) league will bounce back to life today at Khanyisile Sports Centre, following a mid-season break they took during the festive season. BBA head of competitions Charmaine Chirinda said they were expecting an exhilarating weekend of basketball action. “We are expecting fireworks, all teams are playing to win so that they qualify for the national league. We did well with the first part of the season.  The league games went on very well and we hope to continue with the same trend,” said Chirinda. Southern Mavericks who are second on the men’s table open up the weekend fixtures with a tie against bottom placed Ostrich in a potentially explosive encounter. The latter have lost all the matches they have played in the on-going campaign. Mavericks on the other hand have lost once in their six games and are in second place, a point behind leaders Oilers who are inactive this weekend. Victory over struggling Ostrich will place Mavericks top of the table. Defending champions Giants have a date with Lupane State University (LSU) in another mouth-watering encounter on the day. A single encounter is on the cards for the women’s division where Angels face LSU in what promises to be an exciting encounter. Fixtures Men: Mavericks v Ostrich, Giants v LSU, NUST B v Ostrich, Mavericks v City Knights
