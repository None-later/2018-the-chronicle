 Editor â€” Timely farming operations begin with the timely distribution of inputs. All this has a positive bearing on the timing of planting especially now with the devastating impact of climate change. Planting now depends heavily on whether rains come early or late depending on the season and all this in addition to the timely distribution of inputs can determine our agriculture productivity and yield levels. We commend the Government for unveiling inputs for the Presidential Inputs Support Scheme and Command Agriculture earlier than in previous seasons. This makes it possible for farmers to plan early. It is also commendable that some farmers have already started receiving inputs. We hope the Government will continue to provide inputs on time in the coming seasons and beyond. This will certainly lead to the success of our agricultural programmes. Felix Zonke, Harare
