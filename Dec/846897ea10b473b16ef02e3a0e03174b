The Chronicle Responses to “RBZ quartet cleared”. RBZ should conduct routine auditing to curb corruption. Internal security should identify culprits who are involved in illicit currency dealings. Acie made unsubstantiated claims and an investigation proved that. The four directors should simply sue Lumumba. – Mapozho Saruchera. Response to “Knives out for Mudzuri”. Chamisa is afraid of contest hence the decision of eliminating Mudzuri and Mwonzora from the presidential race. Democracy in the MDC died a long time ago. During the 2014 congress the late party leader Morgan Tsvangirai declared that his post was not up for contest and it is this same script that Chamisa has adopted. – Elijah Chihota. Response to “NatPharm to open retail outlets”. I think it’s a good innovation to have Natpharm pharmacies around the country to ensure inclusive access of medicines. The current pharmaceutical industry model really needed a “shake up” given the challenges we are facing. The way private owned retail pharmacies have mushroomed is unacceptable in my view. They are too many and are putting the consumers at ransom with greedy pricing. I would want to think that even manufactures like Varichem, Datlabs, Plus Five should have their own warehouse pharmacies retailing medicines as well and cut on to many middlemen in the form of wholesalers where prices are multiplied. That way Government can ensure its policies with regards to the industry are adhered to. — Dominic Rugare.
