 Michelle Gwizi, Chronicle Reporter A 28-YEAR-OLD Nkayi man has been arrested for allegedly raping his ex-girlfriend twice after threatening her with an axe. In March this year, the victim had a misunderstanding with Tribe Lunga after she avoided to see him for some time due to his violent behaviour.

Lunga appeared before Bulawayo regional magistrate Ms Sibonginkosi Mnkandla facing rape charges and was remanded in custody to August 23. Prosecuting, Ms Concilia Ncube said on April 12 at around 4pm in Haga village, Gwamayaya area, Lunga went to the complainant’s house to ask her if her decision for them to end their affair was final. Their discussion did not go well as Lunga got angry and threatened to assault the complainant. The complainant allegedly fled to her neighbour’s house.
