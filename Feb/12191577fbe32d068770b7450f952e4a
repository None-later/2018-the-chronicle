Walter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent FIVE people, including a three-year-old girl died on the spot in two separate road accidents in Masvingo, police have  confirmed. Masvingo police spokesperson Inspector Charity Mazula said the accidents occurred on Saturday and Sunday.

Insp Mazula said on Saturday, the now deceased Gomba was driving a Toyota Wish towards Masvingo with five passengers on board. She said upon reaching the 50km peg  along the Masvingo-Mbalabala Road, Gomba allegedly lost control of the vehicle and it veered off the road and overturned, killing three people including the driver on the spot. Two other passengers were injured. Insp Mazula said the second accident occurred at the 145km peg along Masvingo-Beitbridge Road when a Ford Ranger double cab travelling from Masvingo towards Beitbridge encroached into the lane of a Harare-bound bus belonging to Jarax Transport. She said two people including a three-year old who were in the Ford Ranger died while the driver, a Mabika from Chipinge, was injured. “The bus which had 29 passengers on board swerved to the left side of the road and stopped but no one died or was injured,” she said. @walterbmswazie3
