 Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent A ZIMBABWEAN man employed as a teacher in South Africa was allegedly killed on Saturday by his pupil who accused him of failing him in school. Kingston Vhiya (42) from Masvingo was allegedly killed by his 15-year-old Grade Eight pupil, according to South African media reports. Vhiya was a teacher at Bosele Middle School in Northern Cape but the subjects he taught were not revealed. According to the reports, a witness Mr Zeky Mangei said the pupil arrived at Vhiya’s house and started throwing stones. “The boy started by throwing stones, breaking windows at the house. He accused Kingston of failing him at school. Kingston told him that he could not blame him for failing and that he should speak to individual subject teachers,” Mr Mangei reportedly said. “The boy had broken the windows and was able to pull out Kingston’s phone, which was on a charger, through one of them (windows). Kingston then opened the door but was hit by a stone on his chest,” He said the situation calmed down after Vhiya engaged the teen who later turned on the teacher, stabbing him with a sharp object in the chest. Mr Mangei said Vhiya was rushed to a local hospital where he later died. Vhiya’s sister Ms Mpho Mthethwa, said the family was devastated by the callous murder of their relative. Ms Mthethwa said they did not have money to repatriate his body. “It will cost us between R30 000 to R50 000 for the repatriation of Kingston’s body to Zimbabwe. We do not have that kind of money,” said Ms Mthethwa. Northern Cape police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Dimakatso Mooi said Vhiya was killed with a sharp object. The reports however, did not state whether the pupil had been arrested or not. @nqotshili
