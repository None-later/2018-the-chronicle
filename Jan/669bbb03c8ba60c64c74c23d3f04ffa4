Kiyapili Sibanda, Business Correspondent THE Zimbabwe Diaspora Investment Group (ZDIG) delegation is in the country for a 10-day visit to explore trade and investment opportunities. The delegation made up of 15 people, two of them from Denmark and the rest from the United Kingdom (UK), arrived in the country on Sunday. ZDIG was formed in the UK in February 2017 to harness Zimbabwe Diasporans’ human and financial resources in order to invest back home. The leader of the group, Mr Hillary Chindodo said they were looking forward to investing in various sectors of the economy. “We are in Zimbabwe on a 10-day Diaspora trade and investment mission to explore opportunities not just for the Diaspora but our network of institutional and private investors. “We have specific projects targeting agriculture, healthcare, tourism and hospitality, mining, state owned enterprises, water reticulation and distribution,” he said. Mr Chindodo said they want to create a platform that will enable those in the Diaspora to invest their savings in Zimbabwe thereby creating employment. He said they would during their stay pay a courtesy call on President Emmerson Mnangagwa as well as meet representatives of different Government ministries. “Investors are excited about the country’s investment prospects. There is certainly a renewed interest in the country judging by the surge in enquiries we are receiving from all over the world,” he said. Mr Chindodo said investors from different countries had shown interest in investing in Zimbabwe. “We were in Denmark and met some investors with an interest in Zimbabwe and we also opened offices in the Nordic region. We have partnered with a company called Afrika Consultancy in Copenhagen run by Mrs Florence Charamba-Christensen,” he said. @Kiyaz_Cool
