Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO Basketball Association (BBA) competitions head Charmaine Chirinda says league action will resume this weekend. The basketball league took a break during the festive season and action is set to resume on Friday. “We are set to resume our league games this Friday. We have a number of outstanding games in the first half of the season and we hope to get through them as quickly as possible. We did well with the first part of the season as the league games went on very well and we hope to continue with the same trend,” said Chirinda. She said they were aiming to create a vibrant junior policy and to spread the game in a bid to improve the quality of basketball in the city. “We want to create a vibrant junior policy with players between the ages of 15 and 16 years. We will be working closely with schools so that we have an effective development policy. We presently have one academy team that has registered with us. We are also taking the game to the people and some of our games will be played in the western suburbs. “A number of tournaments have been lined-up for the second part of a busy second half of the season, which include the inter-provincial and national league competitions. At the moment we are working on dates for the tournaments,” said Chirinda.
