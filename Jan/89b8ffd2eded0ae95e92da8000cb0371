 Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent BURGLARS broke into a Bulawayo shop that sells school uniforms and stole nearly $10 000 which was kept in the company’s safe. The burglars allegedly broke into Esats Shop last week and the theft was discovered on Saturday morning. The incident occurred during busy days as parents and guardians were preparing for a new school term which resulted in increased uniform sales. Bulawayo acting police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Abednico Ncube said the burglars broke into the shop through the roof. “Police are investigating an unlawful entry and theft case which occurred between January 5 and 6 in one of the city’s shops. It is suspected that unknown burglars broke into the shop and stole approximately $10 000 which was kept in the company’s safe box,” said Asst Insp Ncube. He said the burglars are suspected to have used a grinder to break open the safe. “The burglars are suspected to have gained entry through the roof. They then used a grinder to open the safe and stole $10 000,” he said. Asst Insp Ncube urged businesses and members of the public not to keep large amounts of money at their premises. Meanwhile, police have warned motorists not to leave cars with engines running or with ignition keys on. Asst Insp Ncube said police have recently recorded an upsurge in vehicle thefts in the city. “Recently a Mazda truck was stolen in the city centre and dumped in North End suburb. The incident occurred after its driver left the engine running and entered a shop. On his way out he saw his car being driven off,” said Asst Insp Ncube. Last December, an ambulance was stolen at Mpilo Central Hospital after its driver left the engine running. The ambulance was found dumped at Ngozi mine dumpsite and a Bulawayo City Council employee has since been arrested in connection with the theft. – @nqotshili.
