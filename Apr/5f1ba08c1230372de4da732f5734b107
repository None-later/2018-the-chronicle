 Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter THE Victoria Falls Municipality (VFM) has withdrawn a case against its former Housing and Community Services director Mr Lot Syatimbula it wanted evicted from the council house as the parties have agreed to settle the matter out of court. Mr Syatimbula was fired by the local authority last year after he allocated his nephew a housing stand without council approval. He was convicted at the Victoria Falls Magistrate’s Court for criminal abuse of office. Syatimbula was fined $500 and sentenced to a wholly suspended 12 months in jail. The municipality then gave Mr Syatimbula two months’ notice to vacate a house he had been allocated. The former director allegedly refused to move out of the house saying his former employer should first pay him his outstanding terminal benefits amounting to more than $40 000. Mr Syatimbula who served as director between September 1, 2010 and March 31, 2017, argues that the termination of his contract was unlawful. VFM approached the Civil Court last week seeking an order to evict Mr Syatimbula and his family from its house. In addition, the local authority, through its lawyer Mr Thulani Nkala of Dube and Company was seeking holding over damages of $700 per month from October 31 last year to the date of vacation and undisturbed possession of the house. Through his lawyer, Mr Zibuziso Ncube of Ncube and Company, assisted by Mr Givemore Mvhiringi of Mvhiringi and Partners, Mr Syatimbula said he wanted to be paid his terminal benefits first.—@ncubeleon
