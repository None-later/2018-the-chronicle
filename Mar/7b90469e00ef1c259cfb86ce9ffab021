 Showbiz Correspondent A WHOLE season of an upcoming television programme, HotmiX Sessions, will be shot this Friday at Cosmopolitan Night Club in Bulawayo. The television programme, in its first season, will chronicle what happens when DJs take to the decks and how they keep the club pumping. Apart from Cosmopolitan resident DJs Kananjo, Ngwisto and Keezy AM, there will be other wheelspinners DJ Prince Eskhosini, Crazy Dee, Liz, Skaiva, Emity Smooth, Sweeto, Nospa, Teflon, DBongz Deeper, Yugoe and Coaster who will be featured on the show. DJ Mzoe, who will be presenting the show, said they would film the show in the presence of patrons. He said they hoped to record the whole 13-episode season in one night. “We’re shooting the whole season in one night. Each DJ will have a set of 30 minutes which we’ll record as a season. After the sets, we’ll interview each DJ where they will narrate their musical career so that people get to know more about them,” said Mzoe. “Each episode will be dedicated to each DJ that we shall profile.” DJ Mzoe said they wanted their show to capture the real atmosphere in a club, hence why they are recording it live at Cosmopolitan. “We’re taking the show to the club so that people who’re at home know what happens in a club. The audience will also be part of the shoot so we encourage people to come prepared for the cameras.” He said they were in talks with two television stations who they want to buy the rights to the programme. “It hasn’t been confirmed but there’re two television stations who’ve shown interest in the programme. By June, people will know which one we’d have settled for,” said DJ Mzoe.
