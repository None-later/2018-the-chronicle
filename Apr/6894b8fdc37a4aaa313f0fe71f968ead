Josey Mahachi Business Reporter THE Dangote Group says the new political dispensation has given hope for accelerated investments in Zimbabwe through the “open for business” policy. The new political order came into being when President Emmerson Mnangagwa came into power in November last year after the resignation of former President Robert Mugabe. In a statement yesterday after a 10-day visit to the country by a delegation from the Dangote Group, the investor’s representative in Zimbabwe, Mrs Josey Mahachi, said: “This is the second visit by this technical group showing interest in investing in Zimbabwe. The new dispensation and its Zimbabwe is open for business policy has given hope for accelerating investments. “The Dangote Group has been in the country for 10 days and they left in the early hours of 19th April 2018.” The team, which comprised the group’s head of geologists Dr Naresh Kumar and the senior geologist Mohan Gangappa, met with various private sector stakeholders, mining executives and Government officials including Mines and Mining Development Minister Winston Chitando and the Buy Zimbabwe team. Mrs Mahachi said their visits were most insightful and the team was pleased by what they saw and was most appreciative of the support and discussion with the Minister Chitando. “A further update will be provided in due course,” she said. On his first visit to Zimbabwe in 2015, Mr Aliko Dangote, who is Africa’s richest man, met then President Mugabe and pledged to invest in coal mining, cement manufacturing and power generation. Forbes magazine estimates Mr Dangote’s net worth at over $14 billion.
