Andile Tshuma THE Bulawayo Polytechnic continues to priorities the health of its students through maintaining a well equipped and stocked clinic with a stationed nurse. Free HIV counseling and testing services are available for students accompanied with a family planning clinic that provides birth control and family planning services for students. Student psychological health is also of paramount importance at the institution as there are professional counselors available, as well as a chaplain for free counseling sessions. Students have a medical Aid Service that they use in hospital should they have ailments that require more attention than the clinic can offer, in case of injury or accidents. They are guaranteed of secrecy at the clinic as their interaction with the nurses is treated as strictly confidential. In addition, students are safe at Bulawayo Polytechnic as all entry points are under 24 hour guard and surveillance by a competent security personnel. HIV testing, guidanceÂ and counseling services are provided to freshmen or first year students during orientation to help them familiarise with the institution and also as a measure of warning them about pitfalls that they may meet as they venture into the world of adulthood. Spiritual health cannot be left out as the college has a functional Christian Union and has almost all denominations represented. Various churches on campus are given space to conduct services and worship on evenings and on weekends and this ensure that the spiritual life of the student does not die when they leave home. One can find the Roman Catholic Church, Anglican Church, ZAOGA, SDA, different Pentecostals and different Zionist movements all on campus, to cater for different religious orientations.
