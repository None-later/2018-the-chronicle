Thulani “Biya” Ncube Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter UNITED States of America-based former Highlanders and Warriors’ skipper Thulani “Biya” Ncube has asked well wishers to donate to his girls’ soccer team instead of sending him birthday presents. Biya, who made history by captaining Highlanders, the national Under-23 and senior national teams at the same time, is set to celebrate his birthday on September 21, but said he won’t need personal presents and instead appealed to well wishers to donate to the Biya and Friends girls’ soccer team based at Bulawayo’s Gwabalanda suburb. “This is to all my friends that were going to buy me a birthday present on my birthday on September 21. I don’t need one; all I want is a donation to our girls’ soccer team; anything for school, soccer, personal girls’ stuff. Whatever you can, it will be much appreciated. 5 000 friends on Facebook counting on you, one month to go, will keep reminding you. Big thank you in advance,” Ncube posted on his Facebook timeline yesterday. The Biya and Friends team was formed in June this year, joining a family of boys’ team that Ncube formed some years ago. “Investing in girls is one of the smartest things we can do to promote a healthier, more prosperous world. More importantly, it’s the right thing to do. Every girl has the right to be in charge of her future and her fate, and we have the collective obligation to protect her rights and promote her well being. Discrimination has no place in the 21st century and every girl has the right to go to school, stay safe from violence, access health services and fully participate in her community,” said Ncube when he announced the milestone development in June. The girls’ team trains at Luveve Youth Centre every Monday and Friday.
