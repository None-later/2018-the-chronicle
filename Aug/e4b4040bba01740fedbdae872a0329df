Mr Nelson Chamisa It is true that Zimbabwe should not be concerned about what is happening in Washington. We all know that America is fighting from the MDC Alliance  corner. The fact that this Zidera had already been put in place well before the harmonised elections, and that America has never embraced the new Zimbabwe administration, tells the whole story behind its decision to renew sanctions against Zimbabwe. America failed to even condemn Biti’s utterances that led to the violence, which occurred on August 1. Zimbabweans know that America is an agent of regime change in Zimbabwe. They want Zimbabweans to suffer so that their puppets (MDC) are voted into political leadership. — Bodo.
