Chief Magistrate Mr Mishrod Guvamombe Chronicle Reporter RURAL communities are set to benefit from the recent magistrates’ recruitment drive which will see villagers accessing the Victim Friendly Court from their localities. Chief Magistrate Mr Mishrod Guvamombe said the shortage of magistrates had delayed the opening of the Victim Friendly Courts in rural areas. “I am happy to note that there has been progress over the issue as we have recruited more magistrates. Vice President (General Constantino) Chiwenga (Retired) also raised that concern a few days ago and we are  positive that circuit regional courts in places like Tsholotsho will open soon because we have additional magistrates,” said Mr Guvamombe. “Now that we have additional magistrates, we will not hesitate to establish circuit regional courts even in rural areas. Our aim is that we take all court facilities to the people for quality services,” said Mr Guvamombe. Chiefs from Tsholotsho told VP Chiwenga last Wednesday that sexual abuse victims were forced to travel to Bulawayo to attend court cases because courts were not sitting in the district. Chief Mathuphula of Tsholotsho said his community was in need of a functional victim friendly court given the high number of sexual crimes in the area. “We do not want our children who are victims of rape or any sexual offences or other crimes to be travelling to Bulawayo to attend court. “The situation of the abused victims who are already traumatised, is worsened by travelling long distances to attend court and being interviewed by strangers,” said Chief Mathuphula. He said there was a court building constructed for such a purpose though the facility was still not accessible. —@thamamoe
