 Ronaldo set to make Serie A debut for Juventus Milan — Cristiano Ronaldo will make his much-anticipated Serie A debut for Juventus who open their campaign for an eighth straight Italian league title today against a sombre backdrop of a country in mourning following the Genoa bridge disaster. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner was the star signing of the summer season arriving amid great pomp and ceremony following a €100 million deal from Real Madrid. But it could be a low-key start for the 33-year-old Portuguese superstar against minnows Chievo in Verona’s Stadio Bentegodi today on a day of national mourning for the victims of the Morandi bridge tragedy in the north-western port city. The emotional impact of the disaster has led to the postponement of Serie A games involving local teams Sampdoria and Genoa who had been due to open their campaigns against Fiorentina and AC Milan. But all other games will go ahead starting today — the day of the 38 victims’ funerals – with last season’s top two teams Juventus and Napoli in action. A minute’s silence will be held before each match with the players taking to the pitch wearing black armbands. Much is expected of Ronaldo’s presence in the Italian league this season after the low of Italy missing out on qualifying for the World Cup in Russia. “He’s going to raise the level of the championship,” said Italian football legend Dino Zoff.
