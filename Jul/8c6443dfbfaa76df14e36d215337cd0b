President ED Mnangagwa Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter ZANU-PF Youth League national political commissar Cde Godfrey Tsenengamu has said President Mnangagwa is the best person to lead the country as he has acquitted himself well after only six months in office. Cde Tsenengamu said this while addressing hundreds of Zanu-PF supporters from Hwange West Constituency at Jambezi Business Centre on Saturday. The rally was organised to drum up support for President Mnangagwa and the party in the upcoming harmonised elections. He thanked the party’s supporters for turning out in their numbers for the party’s rallies around the country. “I want to thank you all for coming here in your numbers as you have shown support for your party. My message to you is that let’s all go in our numbers and vote for our President Cde Emmerson Mnangagwa in the coming elections. If you look at his history, in just six months he has brought enormous changes to the country especially in the economy. I think all we need to do now is give him a full term to lead us and see how it goes,” said Cde Tsenengamu. Cde Mnangagwa’s new political administration was ushered in last year in November when the former President Mr Robert Mugabe resigned. The party’s candidate for Hwange West is Cde Nkosilathi Jiyane, a former Mayor of Victoria Falls. Speaking at the same occasion, the party’s youth chairman for Matabeleland North Cde Tamuka Nyoni reiterated the party’s position against violence as he condemned the recent attack at White City Stadium in Bulawayo. Cde Nyoni also said those party members who had decided to contest as independent candidates and failed to take heed of the party leadership’s call to rescind their candidature, were making a political mistake. @ncubeleon
