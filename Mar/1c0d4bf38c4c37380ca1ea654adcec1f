 Showbiz Reporter AFRICA Magic and MultiChoice, organisers of the Africa Magic Viewers’ Choice Awards, are calling on filmmakers and actors to enter the 2018 edition taking place on September 1. Liz Dziva, publicity and public relations manager of MultiChoice Zimbabwe, said the AMVCAs competition was an event held to honour film and television talent across Africa. The venue of the awards ceremony is yet to be unveiled. “The AMVCAs were created to celebrate the contribution of African filmmakers, actors and technicians to the success of the continent’s film and television industry. Following the success of the previous five editions, preparations are in top gear for the 2018 edition,” Dziva said. Entries for the AMVCAs opened on March 1 and will close on April 20. “The awards recognise film talent across a range of categories from acting and directing to scriptwriting and cinematography. Other categories will include short film or online video, soundtracks, costume design, sound and lighting and several others, making a total of 27 categories in all, seven of which are open to viewer voting and 20 are decided by a panel of judges.” She said the awards that had taken a brief hiatus were back with a bang. “There’ve been definite improvements in the industry since the inception of the awards, highlighting their value. MultiChoice and Africa Magic are dedicated to helping unearth and celebrate talent on the continent and we know the 2018 edition of the AMVCAs will have an even bigger impact on the African film industry than the previous five successes,” Dziva said. Entry to the AMVCAs is free and films, made-for-television movies or television series are eligible for entry if they have been broadcast or publicly screened during the period October 1, 2016 to March 31, 2018. Entry forms can be obtained from the www.africamagic.tv website.
