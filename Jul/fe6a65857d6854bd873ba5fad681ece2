The company has received commitment that sums due by government were  acknowledged and would be paid. “However, the company awaits sufficient written document to enable  inclusion of sums due in the financial statements.” Mr Moxon said the company sought funding from opportunities which would  unfold in the short term. “These opportunities will in themselves enable the group to achieve a  position of financial strength,” he said. He said Zimbabwe would benefit from a revitalised corporate entity,  with greater opportunities for employment and a more vital creation of  opportunity for both local and foreign investment.  The company, which did not declare a dividend, planned to open a number  of new stores and further upgrade existing ones. In the outlook, the group said growth in profits was expected to  continue. —  New  Ziana.
