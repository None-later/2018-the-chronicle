The Chronicle ZIMBABWE have taken control of Group C at the 2018 Mopani Copper Mines Cosafa Under-20 Championships after a comprehensive 3-0 victory over Lesotho at Shinde Stadium yesterday. Delic Murimba took his tally to three for the tournament, and the early lead on the scorers chart, with the opener for the Young Warriors before Tatenda Tumba added a second just after halftime. Junior Nyamuziwa added the cherry on top with two more for the Zimbabweans, who showed why they will be serious contenders for the title this year after missing out on the knockout stages in the last few editions. Zimbabwe now have six points from their two games and will need just a draw in their final pool clash against Angola on Sunday to book a semi-final spot. Their haul might also be already enough to finish as the best-placed runner-up.
