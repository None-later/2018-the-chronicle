Rahman Gumbo Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Acting Sports Editor LEGENDARY former Highlanders player and coach, Rahman Gumbo, got off to a winning debut as a coach in South Africa when his Witbank Spurs overcame Real Kings in the National First Division on Saturday. A first half Khethukula Zwane thunderbolt was enough for the former Absa Premiership side to collect maximum points on the road. “We maintain our unbeaten record against kings,” boasted Siyavutha, as Witbank Spurs are known, on their official Facebook account. Gumbo fielded three Zimbabweans in his starting line-up, goalkeeper Edmore Sibanda, midfielder Patrick Mubayiwa and striker Cleopas Dlodlo while King Nadolo did not make it to the travelling party. The ambitious outfit has made their intention of returning to the topflight league an open secret this year and believe Gumbo, who they gave a one year  renewable contract, will make them realise their dream. They take on Maccabi at home on Saturday hoping to make it two out of two. The 55-year-old Gumbo is a known tactician with numerous titles, including four championship medals in three different countries. As a rookie way back in 1999, he landed his first league title with Highlanders and managed to return the championship the following season before a diabolic decision to fire him after losing away to Buffaloes on his third season saw him part ways with the Bulawayo giants. He bagged his second league title medal when he led Malawi’s MTL Wanderers to the podium in his first season in 2006 and three years later, Township Rollers of Botswana were beneficiaries of his tactical shrewdness when they lifted the Botswana championship.
