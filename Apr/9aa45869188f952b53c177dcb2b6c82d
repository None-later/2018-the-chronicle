Clr Knowledge Ndlovu Mthabisi Tshuma, Gwanda Reporter GWANDA mayor, Councillor Knowledge Ndlovu, has hailed the new administration for observing people’s rights saying this was critical to developing the country. Clr Ndlovu said this yesterday during a community dialogue meeting dubbed “The Councillor We Want” that was attended by councillors, aspiring councillors, political parties, women organisations, Youths in Mining and NGOs at a local hotel. Clr Ndlovu said the new dispensation has created “a free community.” “The nation is now a free one where one has freedom of speech and after speech. The new Government should be hailed for this. This is of great benefit to the development of the country as criticism is made by affected individuals and through this it helps to easily address these issues,” he said. The mayor also had a message for those seeking political office. “Those to be nominated should be servants of the people not to make people your servants. This is a good strategy to ensure the needs and the wants of the public are catered for,” said Clr Ndlovu. Those who attended the meeting said they expect councillors to be elected in this year’s elections to be humble, fair, ethical in conduct, responsive and to be team players as well as peacemakers. They also hailed council for development projects initiated so far. The mining town constructed a five-mega litre reservoir, installed its first traffic lights, upgraded Pelandaba Stadium and rehabilitated a number of roads. A landfill has also been completed as a replacement for the old one which was directly opposite Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo Polytechnic College. Municipality of Gwanda former Chamber Secretary Mr Eleck Ndlovu said the current leadership should be praised mostly for pioneering the appointment of the first woman Town Clerk, Ms Priscilla Nkala. He said the council should have business minded people in its advisory board so as to attract investment.— @mthabisi_mthire.
