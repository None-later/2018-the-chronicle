Meanwhile, acting Zifa president, Omega Sibanda is in Uganda for a convention of members of the Caf Organising Committee for Development of Futsal and Beach Soccer which commenced on the 26th of March. Among other issues, the committee will deliberate on the 3rd edition of the Beach Soccer Africa Cup of Nations to be hosted by Egypt this year and the bidding procedures for the hosting of the 2020 Futsal Africa Cup of Nations. “The most important thing for us at the moment is to learn from other nations which have successfully established beach soccer and Futsal structures. “Soon we will be having our own development structures, especially for beach soccer because schools in the Harare province have already adopted Futsal into their curriculum,” Sibanda told Zifa’s official website www.zifa.org.zw The committee will also discuss the qualifying process of the Youth Olympic Futsal tournament. In November 2017, Sibanda was appointed  to the committee established by Caf to spearhead the development of Futsal and Beach Football.
