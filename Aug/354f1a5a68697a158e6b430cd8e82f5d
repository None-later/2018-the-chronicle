Edmore Chirambadare Black Leopards coach Joel Masutha says the club decided against signing Zimbabwean left winger Edmore Chirambadare because of foreign quota issues. The 26-year-old Chirambadare was released by Kaizer Chiefs at the end of last season along with the likes of Tsepo Masilela, Keagan Buchanan and Sibusiso Khumalo. Chirambadare, who only managed just five league appearances in the 2017/18 season, started training with Lidoda Duvha, but has since left the Absa Premiership newcomers. “He left because we were trying to … because (Djunga) Munganga now has seven years playing in this country,” Masutha told KickOff.com. “So we had applied for him to play as a local, and get the papers at Home Affairs. So that didn’t go well and at the moment we already have five foreigners; we wanted to put him in Munganga’s space. But since this thing didn’t pass we decided to release him.” Masutha is still hoping his side can play their first game of the season on Saturday against Polokwane City at their slaughterhouse Thohoyandou Stadium. The PSL in midweek inspected the venue, which required upgrades to make it suitable for topflight football. “The stadium has passed. The only thing is for the PSL to confirm if Saturday’s game is going to take place there,” Masutha adds. Leopards were initially scheduled to host Rise and Shine at Peter Mokaba Stadium this weekend. — Kickoff.com
