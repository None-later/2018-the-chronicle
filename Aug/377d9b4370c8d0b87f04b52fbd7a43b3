Roderick Mutuma Mukudzei Chingwere in Gweru Nichrut FC 2 – 0 Yadah Stars RODERICK MUTUMA reminded Yadah Stars of his qualities when the self-styled “Prince of football’’ struck a brace that helped Nichrut to an important Castle Lager Premier Soccer League victory at Ascot yesterday, which helped the hosts move within a point of above the relegation zone. Mutuma, who featured for Yadah last season but had a poor season, scoring just one goal, grabbed his brace for Nichrut either side of half-time. The lanky striker has been enjyig a new lease of life under John Nyikadzino at Nichrut. Mutuma converted a first half penalty, after fellow former Dynamos son Farai Vimisayi was fouled inside the box by Brian Chikwenya. He completed his brace seven minutes from time when he summoned his loads of experience to put the ball under control with his chest before chipping beyond the badly positioned Stephen Chimusoro in goal for Yadah Stars. Yadah Stars were unfortunate not to go level after the breather, especially with their veteran striker Ralph Matema doing all the good work in the final third. But the killer ball that Yadah Stars needed to breach Stanley Chakwana’s goal was missing.
