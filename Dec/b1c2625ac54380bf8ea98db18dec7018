SKYZ Metro FM yesterday revealed the list of performers for the Skyz Metro FM Music Awards ceremony taking place at the Large City Hall in Bulawayo tonight. The much anticipated music awards will see the city’s most talented artistes including Zinjaziyamluma, Sandra Ndebele, Clement Magwaza, Cal Vin, Asaph, Guluva 7, Iyasa, Indosakusa and Novuyo Seagirl take turns to entertain guests. Skyz Metro FM presenters TKP and Babongile Sikhonjwa will be the hosts while Donna N and B-Kay will welcome guests on the red carpet. Award nominees were revealed last month with Magwaza and Seagirl leading the pack with three nominations each. The tightly contested song of the year category where Novuyo ft Lance Hebron – A.E.I.O.U, Nceku’s Vele Angikuzwa, Zinjaziyamluma’s Ebumnandini, Sandra Ndebele’s Lizwile and Magwaza’s Asoyami are nominated will be one to look out for. Other nominated artistes are Cal Vin, Guluva 7, Ndux Junior, Allen Ndoda, Djembe Monks and Indosakusa. The event which kicks off at 7PM will be broadcast live on the Skyz Metro FM Facebook page as well as their radio station. The station’s manager Godwin Phiri said it was all systems go. To add flavour to proceedings, Phiri said there would be surprise guest appearances during the awards ceremony. He however refused to name the guests, but judging from shows in Bulawayo, it might be DJ Maphorisa as he will be performing at Club Cosmopolitan later tonight. Entry tickets have since been reduced from $15 to $10 for ordinary and $30 to $20 for VIP.
