Mr George Charamba Takunda Maodza, Harare Bureau President Mnangagwa was never slotted to address a rally in Hwange yesterday, Secretary for Information, Media and Broadcasting Services Mr George Charamba has said. “The President was never slotted to address a rally in Hwange today. He went in to simply ground-break for Hwange 7 and 8 and then rush back to Harare to meet two trade delegations that are in the country and of course to prepare for tomorrow’s (today) fixture,” said Mr Charamba. The President is flying out of the country today on business. He will address the people of Matabeleland North at a later date. “As a matter of fact we do have a date with Matabeleland North which will be announced in due course,” said Mr Charamba. However, thousands of Zanu-PF supporters had gathered at Hwange Colliery Stadium expecting to be  addressed by the President after the groundbreaking ceremony. President Mnangagwa was in Matabeleland North to ground-break for the expansion of Hwange Thermal Power Station under a                   $1,5 billion facility. The project is expected to feed an additional 600MW into the national grid. It failed to take off during the Robert Mugabe era due to funding challenges. Investors shunned Zimbabwe then, citing an unfriendly investment environment. The new administration under the leadership of President Mnangagwa has opened Zimbabwe for investment through policies that attract capital. Government also prioritises economics ahead of politics and is fighting corruption in all its forms.
