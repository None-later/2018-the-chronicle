A 38-YEAR-OLD man from Bulawayo has been sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for raping an 18-year-old woman in Pumula suburb as punishment for not having money. Clement Moyo had pleaded not guilty to assault and rape before Bulawayo regional magistrate Ms Sibonginkosi Mnkandla but was convicted due to overwhelming evidence. He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment but will serve an effective ten years after two years were suspended on condition of good behaviour. Mr Simbarashe Manyiwa for the state said Moyo raped the complainant in July this year. “On July 1 this year at around 2AM, the complainant was alone in her bedroom when Moyo and his accomplices broke into the house and demanded cash. “When she told them she had no money, the rest of the gang left but Moyo remained behind,” said Mr Manyiwa. He said Moyo then assaulted the complainant before raping her once and left. — @gwizi_n.
