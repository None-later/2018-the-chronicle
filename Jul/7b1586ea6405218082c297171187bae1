Munyaradzi Chidzonga Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent FORMER Big Brother housemate Munyaradzi Chidzonga has revealed that he will feature on South Africa’s leading soapie Generations: The Legacy next month. The Diamond boy, as Chidzonga is known, has been making inroads in Mzansi showbiz since debuting on etv’s Rhythm City in recent years. Chidzonga will join fellow Zimbabwean Chiedza Mhende (Wandile) on the SABC 1 soapie as he told his Facebook followers that he will play a detective. Sharing a picture of himself in character and on set, Chidzonga said: “Another day in the office. 4am call time. New role on Generations: The Legacy loading. Catch Detective Chakunda next month. Dates to be advised,” posted Chidzonga. According to website TvSA, the August teasers for Generations: The Legacy reveal that there is a captain who receives a frantic call from the border. This happens on August 16 and most probably the captain being refereed to here is Chidzonga’s character, a Detective Chakunda. Chidzonga becomes the latest Zimbabwean on the South African soapie circles after Mbonisi Mahonondo aka Mbo Mahocs, who joined Scandal last month. Chidzonga rose to fame when he represented Zimbabwe in the 2010 edition of “Big Brother Africa” where he came second. After the Big Brother debacle, he starred in the movie Lobola, which certified him as a talented actor. In 2011, he stared in another movie, The Gentleman, which featured top South African actor Presley Chweneyegae, earning himself a National Arts Merit Award for Best Actor as the film became a success at international film festivals. He also featured in Something Nice from London, an adaptation of Petina Gappa’s book An Elegy for Easterly.
