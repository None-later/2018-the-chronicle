Winky D Kiyapili Sibanda, Showbiz Reporter NETONE in partnership with the Midlands State University (MSU) Student Representative Council (SRC) will be hosting Winky D for the first time in Gweru after the launch of his Gombwe album. The event that has been themed the “One Fusion Campus Concert” will take place tomorrow (Friday) at the Midlands Hotel. Winky D will be backed by artistes, Judgement Yard, Jah Signal, Legion and DJ Blesh. Posting on their Facebook page, NetOne said this was an ultimate concert for all university students. For one to attend, they simply have to buy either a $3 OneFusion package or a OneMoney debit card. Students will be required to bring their IDs. Non university students have not been left out as they can pay $5 to attend the event. Winky D, one of the most sought after artistes locally, seems to be playing quite popular among university students as he attracted a bumper crowd at the Nust grounds in Bulawayo at a show he staged there just after launching his album in Harare. @Kiyaz_Cool
