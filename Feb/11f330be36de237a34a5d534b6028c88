Grace Nyoni, Midlands Reporter REDCLIFF Municipality has unveiled 4 000 housing stands in a bid to clear a housing backlog which stands at about 6 000. In an interview, the Mayor Councillor Fred Kapuya said the residential stands had been given to private developers in Rutendo suburb. “We have unveiled 4 000 stands to private developers in Rutendo suburb. The stands are not serviced and the private developers will make sure that they provide roads, sewer and water system before people start building their houses,” he said. Clr Kapuya said the new batch of stands was coming after the local authority recently ran out of residential stands to sell to potential house owners after former employees of the defunct Zisco started receiving part of their outstanding salaries backdated to 2009 bought all the residential stands that were on sale in the town. He said they were expecting a further 200 residential stands soon after engaging private land developers. “We had stands in Simbi Park, Renin, Rutendo and Grasslands but all of them have been bought. “The scramble for the stands has been happening in the past month.  We have since approached Pure Gold Property Developers for the development of new stands. “So we are expecting a further 200 stands to be availed as soon as possible,” said Clr Kapuya.
