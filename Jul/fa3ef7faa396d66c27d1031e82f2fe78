Vice President Kembo Mohadi Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau Vice President Kembo Dugishi Mohadi’s younger brother, Steven (58) who died in Harare last week will be buried at his rural home in Beitbridge on Saturday, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga has said. He said it was sad that Steven will be buried while his brother was undergoing treatment in South Africa for injuries sustained during a bomb blast at White City Stadium in Bulawayo. Speaking during a political rally held at Zhovhe Dam in Beitbridge West Constituency, VP Chiwenga said they had since received the nod to proceed with the burial arrangements from his colleague. “We sympathise with Vice President Mohadi’s situation and he has since given us the greenlight to bury his young brother on Saturday,” he said. “This is a tragedy, nobody deserves to be in such a situation. Vice President Mohadi and Steven were the only surviving boys in their father’s house. “As Government we are touched by his situation, where he lost his younger brother when he should be focusing on recovering. “What happened in Bulawayo on June 23 is barbaric and should be condemned at all costs. However, let me warn the perpetrators that we will catch up with them and we are not scared. “We have seen worse and they will not stop us from holding harmonised elections on 30 July”. He said the law would catch up with those behind the infamous incident, which left 49 people injured among them Vice President Mohadi and Zanu-PF national chairperson Cde Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri who was expected in the country yesterday after successfully underdoing medical treatment in South Africa. Two people later died in hospital. President Mnangagwa paid his condolences to the Mohadi family. The late Steven Mohadi who succumbed to a short illness at Trauma Centre in the capital was a war veteran and a former Zimbabwe National Army officer and a member of Zipra who trained with the Tank battalion.
