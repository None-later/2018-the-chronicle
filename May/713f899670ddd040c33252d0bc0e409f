 Sylvester Chiramba, Court Reporter A MAN from Bulawayo is battling for life in hospital after being assaulted with a hammer in Nkulumane suburb. Prosper Sibanda (19) from Nkulumane suburb allegedly assaulted Mr Last Lunga, who is from the same suburb, once on the head with a hammer after a misunderstanding on Saturday. The attack allegedly occurred after Mr Lunga ordered Sibanda and his friends off his yard as they were attempting to assault his younger brother Mr Initial Manyemba. Mr Lunga sustained severe head injuries and lost consciousness and was rushed to Mpilo Central Hospital. Sibanda was not asked to plead when he appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Lungile Ncube yesterday facing attempted murder charges. Mr Ncube remanded him in custody to June 6 and advised him to apply for bail at the High Court. Prosecuting, Mr Kenneth Shava told the court that on Saturday at around 5 PM, Sibanda and his friends went to Mr Lunga’s place of residence. “They were attempting to assault Mr Lunga’s brother,” said Mr Shava. “Mr Lunga ordered them to leave his yard and Sibanda responded by striking him once on the head with a hammer. Mr Lunga fell down and became unconscious.” He was ferried to hospital for medical examination and a medical report may be produced in court as evidence. A police report was made leading to Sibanda’s arrest. @SlyCee10
