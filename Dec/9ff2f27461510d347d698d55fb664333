BULAWAYO Polytechnic College will this Sunday play host to the inaugural blind football workshop whose objective is to impart knowledge and technical activities to teachers from surrounding areas. The teachers will be expected to cascade that knowledge to their learners. “There will be practical activities with visually impaired players from different institutions and the community,” said Keon Richardson, blind football development coordinator for the Zimbabwe National Paralympic Committee. The International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) is in charge of a wide range of sports for athletes that are visually impaired or partially sighted. It was founded in April 1981 when representatives from 30 countries met at the Unesco headquarters in Paris, France, to set up the organisation. Football for the blind and partially sighted, which started out as a playground game for pupils in special schools for the visually impaired, has now become one of the most popular sports for people with visual impairment worldwide.
