BULAWAYO-based former footballers will play an exhibition game against a Plumtree Select in the annual Jonah Football Tournament to be held tomorrow at Nyabane, in Bulilima. The former players, will play in the curtain raiser for the final at the annual Christmas Day competition. Four teams, Southern Region Division One Soccer League outfit Mainline FC, Azuri FC of Nyabane, Mganwini Celtics and Plumtree Chiefs will battle it out in the football tournament. In netball, Nyabane Queens will clash against Plumtree Queens. South Africa-based businessman Jonathan Ndlovu, who is into the construction industry and has also been bankrolling primary schools’ tournaments in Bulilima, has set aside R20 000 as prize money for the tournament. Ndlovu believes the presence of former players will play a big role in inspiring youngsters from the rural areas. “I believe there is abundant talent in Plumtree which is not being tapped. “Hopefully, this tournament will play a big role in identifying players for Mainline FC and other competitive teams that will send scouts. My hope is that the presence of former players who played in the topflight, will inspire the youngsters. “This annual tournament is part of my efforts to give back to the community,” said Ndlovu.
