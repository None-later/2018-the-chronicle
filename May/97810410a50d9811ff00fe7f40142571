Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent Four talented young writers have launched a unique book that they co-authored called Sworn to the depths of Inyangani that tackles the mysteries of Mount Inyangani in Manicaland that is infamous with stories of people disappearing. Lindiwe Dhlakama, Takatso Sibanda, Rejoice Moyo and Banabas Karuma under the collabowriters project wrote the book using relay authoring better known as exquisite corpse. The launch was held last Friday at the British Council in Bulawayo with renowned writer Phatisa Nyathi as guest of honour. The book tells the story of a college student, Elisha, who begins having extraordinary dreams and later discovers there is more to this realm than he has always assumed. In the dream, an old woman visits him with a set of inexplicable instructions which throw Elisha’s orderly life into disarray. After first ignoring the dreams, they start manifesting in real life, forcing him to travel to an inyanga against his parents’ wishes. Together with his friend, Takudzwa, they uncover secrets about Elisha and his family that they never imagined. Nyathi said he was impressed that the book was written about African myths by such young writers.
