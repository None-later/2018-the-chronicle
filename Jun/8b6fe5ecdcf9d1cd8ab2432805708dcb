Elvis Moyo Mukudzei Chingwere, Midlands Bureau SOUTH AFRICAN Premiership side Baroka FC has stepped-up their bid to recruit FC Platinum star Kelvin Moyo, with the club representatives having started negotiating with the defender. Moyo charmed a number of South African clubs during the Warriors successful campaign to win a sixth COSAFA Cup title early this month. Early this year, his compatriot Kaitano Tembo was determined in recruiting the centreback for Supersport United. After realising the competition for the signature of the 25-year-old, representatives from Baroka FC met the defender, this month, to discuss a possible switch. But the deal could not be finalised without the involvement of FC Platinum who have a running contract with the player until the end of 2019. Player agent Gibson Mahachi said it was not only Baroka FC who were interested in Moyo but a number of other clubs. “Kelvin is an FC Platinum player and his club is best positioned to comment about their player, talk to them they will give you a proper position. “Yes, it is true that many clubs in South Africa are interested in him, it is not only one club that wants him but there are a number. “I cannot tell you the names of the clubs that are interested in his services for professional reasons, it is still premature to make any comment. “But, like I said, the player belongs to FC Platinum and they are the ones who have to make a comment about their player,” said Mahachi. If Moyo’s move materialises he will hope to make an immediate impact at the club like former teammate Talent Chawapiwa who had a brilliant season with them. Baroka recently completed the signing of former Chicken Inn goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze.
