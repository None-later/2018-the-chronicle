 Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief REDCLIFF Municipality has recorded a 52 percent surge in revenue inflows between September and November on the back of the $38 million windfall availed to ex-Zisco workers. Last year, the Government partly paid outstanding salaries to employees of the defunct Redcliff-based steel manufacturing firm backdated to 2009. In September 2017, the municipality collected $153 404 while $233 443 was collected in October and $287 221 in November. It is envisaged that the December and January inflows were likely to hover around $300 000. Redcliff Town Clerk Mr Gilson Chakauya said the town which has a population of about 42 500 residents and more than 9 800 households, has been performing positively in terms of revenue collection in the months under review. He said they were pleased that revenue inflows at the local authority were improving adding that if Government continues paying ex-Zisco workers, revenue inflows at Redcliff were likely to reach $300 000. “In September we collected $153 404, $233 443 in October and $287 221 in November and we know we collected more in December. “This positive development is attributed to the $38 million windfall made available by the Government as part of the outstanding salaries for former Zisco employees. Mr Chakauya said council was accepting all modes of payments from cash to mobile money transfers and bank transfers. He said council was also selling upgraded housing units to sitting tenants, a development that also significantly boosted revenue inflows. It is hoped that the resuscitation of the steel producer would breathe new life to Redcliff town. Last year, Government signed a $1 billion investment deal with a Chinese investor R and F Company to resuscitate operations at the Redcliff steel plant.
