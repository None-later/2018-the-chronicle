Mpilo Hospital Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter PROCEEDS from the inaugural Vice President Kembo Mohadi Charity Cup pitting Highlanders and Caps United set for Sunday at Barbourfields Stadium will be given to Mpilo Central Hospital’s Cancer Unit and other charitable organisations. Speaking at a media engagement on Thursday, committee spokesperson Ndumiso Gumede said VP Mohadi had identified Mpilo Hospital Cancer Unit as one of the beneficiaries of the proceeds from the match. “A few business people three weeks ago decided that it was prudent to organise something for VP Mohadi to celebrate his appointment. They decided to come up with the KCD Mohadi Shield which Highlanders and Caps United will battle for on Sunday. We will also have a fundraising a dinner a week after the match to congratulate Cde Mohadi and proceeds from both events will go to charity,” said Gumede. The other charities that could benefit from the proceeds are Entembeni Old People’s Home and  Ekuphumuleni Geriatric Nursing Home. Gumede said he had been tasked to take care of the football side and the game has been cleared by the authorities with the gate charges pegged at $3 for the rest of the ground, $5 for the wings and $10 for the VIP. There will be a curtain raiser match before the main game and entertainment in the form of music with Clement Magwaza set to belt out some of his hits. Gumede called on the fans to come in their numbers: “ We call on the people to come in their numbers to celebrate with us, this game is not a political event,” he said. The former Zifa vice-president and ex-Highlanders’ chief executive officer said $30 000 has been set aside for the tournament but the organisers were yet to come up with the prize-money for the winners.
