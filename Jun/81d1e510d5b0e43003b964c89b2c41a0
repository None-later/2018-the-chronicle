 Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent A MAN who has been on the run after allegedly teaming up with brothers – Nelson and Ernest Timothy Masendeke -to kill a rival suitor has been arraigned before a Kwekwe magistrate. Joseph Dzipe (28) was remanded in custody to 20 June by Magistrate Mr Storey Rushambwa for the murder of Happison Mashaba whom they had caught being intimate with Ernest’s girlfriend, Cynthia Dube. Mr Rushambwa advised him to apply for bail at the High Court. Ernest was arrested two days after the April 12 killing and is out on bail while his younger brother Nelson is still at large. The State alleges that on around 3:30AM on the day of the murder, Dzipe of 13 B Usayi in Kadoma was with the two Masendeke brothers when they visited Dube at her house in Mbizo. They allegedly found Mashaba hiding under the bed. Ernest, the court heard, went to his car which was parked outside and returned armed with a rubber sjambok and a baton. The three allegedly took turns to whip Mashaba until he became unconscious. Mashaba was ferried to Kwekwe District Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival.
