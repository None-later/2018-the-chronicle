Dj Liz Showbiz Correspondent TWO of Bulawayo’s top DJ’s Liz and Nospa will hold a joint birthday party at Cosmopolitan Night Club tomorrow to celebrate life and the years they have been in the industry. During their careers, the two wheel spinners have performed at various high end events in the city and now command a reasonable following. DJ Nospa, who wowed students at the One Fusion Campus party and Miss Nust, has performed alongside Black Motion and Black Coffee. He said the dress code for the birthday party was military green. “April is always a month that’s close to my heart because those who I love – my mother, father and niece were all born in April. “I’m celebrating life and maturity in the industry,” said DJ Nospa. Last year, DJ Nospa said he was on a quest to get married, but unfortunately, he has not yet found a partner. “I’ve been single for almost 10 months after the previous relationship I was in collapsed. I’m still hopeful that I’ll get married and soon,” he said.
