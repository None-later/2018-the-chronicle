 Zambia Under- 17 National Soccer Team DEFENDING champions Zambia have declared their readiness for the Group B challenge at the 2018 Cosafa Under-17 Championships in Mauritius from July 19-29. But the 2017 winners will be without a familiar face on the touchlines for the second successive tournament. Coach, Oswald Mutapa, is still serving the final month of his two-year suspension from regional competition after his 2016 team was expelled for age-cheating. However, Mutapa has been helping out with preparations from home as part of his transition back into the job after his 24-month ban. He will travel to Mauritius as an observer in the stands, while coach Tenant Chilumba will oversee proceedings on the touchline. The defending champions are in a tough Group B at the tournament Mauritius is hosting for a third successive year along with 1994 runners-up Mozambique, Lesotho and record two-time winners South Africa. “You know Zambia being a powerhouse in the southern region, people always expect us to win and being the defending champions expectations are high. It is also a challenge again for the team, defending the championship that will see the winner eventually qualifying for the Under-17 Afcon,” Mutapa said. “We have also been talking about it (my suspension), and yes, I am still the Under-17 head coach, but I won’t be on the bench. There will be coaches there to guide the team.” Expectations are even higher this year with the Cosafa Under-17 Championship winners earning qualification to the Tanzania 2019 Under-17 Afcon tournament following the zoning of the continental junior qualifiers for the competition by Caf in 2017. Zambia are currently in the final phase of preparations after a month-long training camp in Lusaka. The defending champions will play Mozambique in their opening Group B match on July 19 before taking on Lesotho in their penultimate game on July 22. Zambia will face South Africa two days later in their final Group B match. — Cosafa
