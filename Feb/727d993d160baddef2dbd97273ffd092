Meynard Moyo Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter A 14-member Highlanders darts squad left the city yesterday for the annual National Darts Association of Zimbabwe (Ndaz) Champion of Champions tournament set for Zesa Munyati in Kwekwe today. Highlanders are one of the two teams that will represent Bulawayo in the annual tournament that has been dominated by Mashonaland West province. “We are the debutants of the tournament but we hope to do well, looking at that we are Bosso and we have a reputation and brand to protect. It’s not going to be easy, that we know but we will give it out best shot,” said the Highlanders darts club spokesperson Lethukuthula Nkomo. Together with Railstars, the two sides will carry the city’s hopes against 13 other provincial representatives where winners will get $500 plus gold medals. Ndaz secretary general Stephen Mwarindira said all was set for the annual tourney and they were looking forward to an exciting clash. “As the leadership we are happy, so far so good. A total of 15 teams will partake at this year’s tournament, representing all but two provinces, Mashonaland East and Matabeleland North. We are making efforts to revamp the sport in Matabeleland North and we were expecting ZRP Lupane to make it but I suspect they wrote their release letter a bit late,” said Mwarindira. As usual, Mashonaland West, driven by the darts grandmaster David Nyemba and his son Kudzanayi, will be the team to beat. According to Mwarindira, the other teams that will take part at this year’s tournament are Flying Eagles and Raylton from Harare, Madziro Snippers and Scorpions from Mashonaland Central, Redwing and Golden Arrows from Manicaland, Buchwa Support United and Tamakwa from the Midlands, Blanket Mine, Gwanda district from Matabeleland South, Mwenazana from Masvingo as well as the two teams from Mashonaland West, A team and Rio Zim. Ndaz president Meynard Moyo is expected to grace the occasion as usual. — @skhumoyo2000.
