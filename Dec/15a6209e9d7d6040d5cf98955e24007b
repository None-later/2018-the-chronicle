THE Organisation of Rural Associations for Progress (Orap) will this Friday hold a soccer tournament in Nkayi North to unearth, promote and nurture talent in rural areas. Orap is an organisation that fights all forms of poverty through the empowerment of people. The organisation’s chief financial officer Bryton Malandule said the soccer tournament seeks to encourage youths in the rural areas to participate in sports. “Our programme is meant to motivate and inspire youths as well as send a loud and clear message that through sports they can employ themselves. “Our mission is to counter poverty by assisting the youths to be involved in professional sports,” said Malandule. He said the idea is to spread the empowerment message to as many communities as possible. “Our philosophy revolves around the core concept of ‘Zenzele’, which stems from the African saying Akusimuntu ongasimuntu walutho which simply shows that we believe everyone has got his or her talent despite the background,” said Malandule He said young people should know that sport is a business and as such can be a source of livelihood. Malandule said through soccer tournaments such as the Nkayi one, talent is exposed as some big clubs send officials to scout for talent. “We signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Highlanders so that these underprivileged youngsters can get an opportunity to play professional football. These rural kids are as a result given the same exposure as their urban counterparts,”he said. Malandule, who is also a newly elected Zifa executive committee member, said Orap president and Minister of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Sithembiso Nyoni will grace the event. — @DecoDecent2
