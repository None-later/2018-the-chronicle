Stanford was sentenced to 25 years in jail while Misheck was sentenced to 17 years. The two had eight years suspended on condition of good behaviour meaning Stanford with serve an effective 17 years in jail while Misheck will serve nine. Passing sentence, Mr Nemadire said the two were a danger to society. “You displayed the worst cruelty by kidnapping and forcing a woman to walk naked while carrying a heavy sack of maize. You went on to take turns to rape her,” said Mr Nemandire. He said in passing sentence the court had taken into consideration Misheck’s age and was of the view that he was influenced by his brother hence he was sentenced to less years. Mr Nemandire however said the two deserved deterrent sentence for treating a woman like a mere object. Lloyd Mavhiza represented the state.
