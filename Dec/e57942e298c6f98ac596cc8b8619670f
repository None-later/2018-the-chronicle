Government of Japan yesterday signed three grant contracts worth US $270 779 to improve the human security of rural communities in Zimbabwe. Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security (GGP) scheme which was launched in Zimbabwe in 1989 has supported basic human needs for the most vulnerable communities in remote areas across the country. Two of the Projects are in field of education, for improvement of the educational school environment at Manhanga Primary School in Kariba and Musena Secondary School in in Chirumanzu District. The remaining project is in the field of the healthcare, for improvement of X-ray equipment of Chikombedzi Mission Hospital in Chiredzi District. Speaking at the signing ceremony in Harare, Japanese Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Toshiyuki Iwado, emphasised the importance of ownership of the projects by the beneficiary institutions and local authorities. He said facilities will be constructed with the participation of all involved. “The most important aspect that we always emphasise concerning GGP projects is ownership by the benefiting communities so that the projects are sustainable and fulfil their purpose for many years to come. In this regard close collaborations between NGO, local government and communities is essential. Everyone must work together right from the start and be involved in all aspects of the project as in the saying ‘‘kuturika denga remba kubatirana,’’ meaning that to put a roof on the walls of a hut needs joining hands,” he said “Of course, the local community may not be able to contribute in monetary terms but if they feel ownership in the project they are often more than willing to readily contribute their time, effort and locally available materials.” Ambassador Iwado said a new digital X-ray machine made by Fujifilm will be provided to Chikombedzi Mission Hospital which operated for the last five years without an X-ray machine.
