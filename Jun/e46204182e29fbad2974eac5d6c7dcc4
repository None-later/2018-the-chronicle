 They say children do the funniest things. Sometimes it’s true, but on other occasions the things they do can land their parents in a lot of trouble. That’s the case of one dad, who was almost in the dog house after his daughter found a funny item in his car. The dad explained the situation on social media, and it’s just as awkward as you would expect. He began by revealing how his four-year-old daughter surprised him and his wife by asking her mum why her bra was in dad’s car. The dad, who uses the Twitter handle @AngryManTV, was shocked by the comment and says the Mrs began giving him a “killer side eye” as she hadn’t been in his car in weeks. The dad then said: “Ain’t no bra in my car.” His daughter replied with: “Ya huh, the cup thingie with straps.” Shocked, the three headed to the garage to go and look for the offending item. Instead of a bra, the family saw a disposable face mask — the kind people use when working in environments where they are exposed to dust and other particles. The dad shared a picture of the mask on Twitter, before posting a picture of a man looking relieved. The tweet has since had over 13 000 retweets and 24 000 likes. People found the child’s mix-up hilarious, but many were quick to point out that the dad was in hot water where the youngster was concerned. One user said: “The good thing is, you know where her loyalties lie. The bad thing is, it’s not with you. Keep your eyes on that one.” Another wrote: “Lmaoooo this man saw his life flashing before his eyes, guaranteed her was already thinking ‘who on earth would frame/test me like this’ on the way to the garage.” A third added: “Lmao I was mommy gang all the way as a child. My daddy couldn’t breathe wrong around me.” — Daily Mail
