 Pennsylvania — A Pennsylvania man is facing charges after police say the 19-year-old attacked his family while tripping on LSD and then resisting arrest while naked and covered in cooking  oil. The Tribune Review says a number of more serious charges including assault and terrorist threats were dropped after the victims refused to pursue charges against him at a preliminary hearing on Tuesday. Police say Lonnie Beatty had taken the hallucinogen on January 16 and lost control, assaulting two female relatives and their children. Police say he destroyed a North Apollo house and the victims hid in a bathroom. The family dog bit Beatty trying to protect them. When police arrived, they say he was naked, wearing only a sock, and covered in cooking oil. They say he was shot with a stun gun after refusing to comply multiple times. No attorney information is available. — AFP
