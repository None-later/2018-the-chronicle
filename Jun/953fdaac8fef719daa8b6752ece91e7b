 Grace Nyoni, Midlands Reporter A 22-YEAR-OLD murder suspect from Redcliff has been arrested at Gokwe Police Station where he had gone to make a false robbery report against his two alleged accomplices. Acting Midlands province police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Ethel Mukwende confirmed the arrest of Desire Mangena in connection with the killing of a man on June 14 at Rutendo shopping centre in Redcliff. She said Mangena allegedly committed the murder in the company of two other accomplices only identified as Timothy alias Terrence and Dion. “On June 14 Mangena and his two accomplices known as Timothy alias Terrence and Dion went to Rutendo shopping centre in Redcliff where they found the now deceased Mr Leopold Muchana Moyo drinking beer at Big-bar club. “The three had a misunderstanding with Mr Moyo resulting in them assaulting him with machetes all over his body. After committing the offence they fled from the scene leaving him lying on the ground bleeding,” said Asst Insp Mukwende. Mr Moyo, Asst Insp Mukwende said, was ferried to Kwekwe District Hospital but succumbed to the injuries the following day. A day after committing the crime, Mangena went to Gokwe Police Station and reported that he had been robbed by two men after boarding a Toyota Wish from Kwekwe to Gokwe. Mangena identified himself to the police as Admire Sibanda of Mkoba in Gweru. “He had injuries all over his body and alleged that a machete was used to inflict them,” she said. Asst Insp Mukwende said investigations were made and it was discovered that the Mkoba address he had given did not exist. Further investigations, Asst Insp Mukwende said, revealed that Mangena had been assaulted and dumped by his accomplices after they had a misunderstanding.
