 Yemurai Ushamba, Chronicle Reporter A MARRIED police officer stationed at Bulawayo Central Police Station who is paying maintenance for six children he sired with four women has approached the court seeking a downward variation in two of the maintenance cases. Simbarashe Andrew dragged his ex-girlfriends Ms Sally Hwede and Ms Audrey Sifelani seeking a reduction in the money he is paying them for maintenance. Andrew said he wanted maintenance to be reduced from $80 to $25 for a minor child he has with Ms Hwede. He was also seeking a downward variation from $50 to $25 for the money he pays for the upkeep of a child he has with Ms Sifelani. Andrew said he could not afford the deductions from his salary since he was married and the payments were leaving him with “peanuts.” “Your worship I am also paying $170 for four minor children. I earn $429 a month. I am married and I have a minor child with my wife. After all the deductions for maintenance for the six children, my family and I are left with peanuts,” he said. “I request that the money for the upkeep of my children be reduced from $80 to $25 and from $50 to $25 respectively. The money for both parties is being deducted directly from SSB which leaves me with nothing to offer my family.” Bulawayo magistrate, Miss Sharon Rosemani, ordered the money for the upkeep of his one minor child with Ms Hwede to be reduced from $80 to $50. However, she dismissed the second downward variation application and said $25 which he wants to pay for a child he had with Ms Sifelani was not enough considering the child was at school. — @YUshamba
