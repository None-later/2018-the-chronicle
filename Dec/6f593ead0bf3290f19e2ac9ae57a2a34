ALL is set for the annual Christmas Day netball and football competitions set for this morning at Nyabane Business Centre, in Bulilima, 30km outside Plumtree town. Nyabane Queens will clash against Plumtree Queens in the only netball match. Four men’s teams, Southern Region Division One Soccer League outfit Mainline FC, Azuri FC of Nyabane, Mganwini Celtics and Plumtree Chiefs will compete in the football tournament. South Africa-based businessman Jonathan Ndlovu, who is into the construction industry and has also been bankrolling primary schools’ tournaments in Bulilima, has set aside R20 000 as prize money for the tournament. Bulawayo-based former footballers are expected to play an exhibition game against a Plumtree Select as the main curtain raisers to the final. “We’re ready to go. The winner will get R5 000, a playing kit, trophy, medals and a match ball with the losing finalist going home with R2 500, a kit, medals and a match ball. The other two men’s teams will each get R1 000. There are also individual prizes like The Player of the Tournament and the Top Goal Scorer. We have also set aside prizes for netball and all in all we’ve set aside R20 000 to host a successful tournament,” said Ndlovu. Meanwhile, six teams will also battle it out at a soccer tournament to be held today at St Joseph’s Primary School in Kezi. Despite showcasing rural talent, the tourney is also meant to counter crime by keeping youths and fans occupied. The participating teams have been grouped into two pools with hosts St Joseph’s FC pitted against Maphisa based side The Venue and Ndolwane while Group B has Bango FC, Bheula and Barcelona. All the teams contributed R2 000 each which adds up to R12 000 and the champions will walk away with R8 000. — @ZililoR.
