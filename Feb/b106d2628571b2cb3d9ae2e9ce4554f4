 Prince Sunduzani, Business Reporter THE Lupane Local Board has invited potential investors to construct a shopping mall and a hotel and conference centre as it braces for the growth of the town. The growing population on the back of the expansion of the Lupane State University (LSU) and anticipated public and private sector investments, have increased demand for consumer services in the Matabeleland North capital. This week, the local authority flighted two tender advertisements inviting investors to undertake  key infrastructure development projects as part of measures to develop Lupane into a modern town. “Interested companies/ or individuals are invited to tender for an 6.86 ha shopping mall site and an 9.5 ha hotel and conference Centre site along Bulawayo road within Lupane Local Board development area and for the development of a shopping mall and a Hotel and Conference centre,” read part of the advertisement. Investments proposals in various sectors like agriculture, energy, mining, tourism and research are likely to steer the growth of the town. Lupane District holds Zimbabwe’s pioneer gas project, which is ready for commercial exploitation. With a growing population after LSU moved most of its services to the main campus, there seems to be a need for a proper shopping mall for students, lecturers and other civil servants. At the moment, students commute to Bulawayo for shopping and accessing other critical services. — @PrinceNkosy102.
