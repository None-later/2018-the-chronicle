Joel Luphahla Lovemore Zigara in Gweru ZIFA Central Soccer League (CSL) side TelOne has unveiled former Highlanders and Warriors’ winger Joel Luphahla as their head coach. Luphahla takes over from Jeremiah Neganda, who quit the Wi-Fi Boys at the end of last year to join CSL new boys Sheasham. Luphahla said he is building a young side with a lot of talented players with the aim of nurturing them to play in the world’s elite leagues. “I have a lot of unknown talent which I believe can be developed and play in the big leagues of Africa and beyond. This is what I tried to do when I joined Border Strikers and I am continuing from where I left off,” said Luphahla. “I have only brought two players, who have Premiership experience, to come and stabilise the side. I have brought in Mostafa Gonyere and Pride Ziwengwa, who were with Tsholotsho last year, and I am confident they will be able to do the job for us.” On his targets with TelOne, the former Bosso attacker, who also saw action in Cyprus, said he is aiming to finish in the top four at the end of the season. “I want to give credit to my predecessor as he did a good job after finishing in the top eight last season. It means he had a good team and he leaves us with a challenge to continue from where he left off and try to do better. I have set myself a target of finishing in the top four for this year and anything else for us will be a bonus,” he said. Luphahla joins TelOne from Border Strikers, who folded halfway through last season but are reportedly making efforts of a comeback to the CSL. He also has had a stint at Caps United as an assistant coach. @lavuzigara1
