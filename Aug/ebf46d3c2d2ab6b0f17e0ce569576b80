Tendai Biti Editor — It’s about time the people of Zimbabwe tell the opposition MDC Alliance leaders to rethink the way they are running their politics. Surely, we cannot be imprisoned in our own country because of power hungry political leaders, who are only happy to see their own people suffer. Sanctions do not hurt leaders or other well-heeled individuals in our society, but their brunt is faced by ordinary people. MDC Alliance leaders, Nelson Chamisa and Tendai Biti went to America and requested that more sanctions be put in place against Zimbabwe. One really wonders why. The late Morgan Tsvangirai (May his soul rest in peace), did the same thing and asked his colonial handlers; United Kingdom, United States and European Union to impose sanctions on Zimbabwe. These opposition leaders in Africa have no people at heart. Zimbabweans from all walks of life, wherever they are, should demonstrate against these sanctions. We should protest at every MDC Alliance office until they go and tell their masters to remove their sanctions without any conditions. And this should be done peacefully. It’s time we as Zimbabweans send a petition to the US government imploring them to reconsider their stance on MDC Alliance driven sanctions, since they are hurting the poor masses of our nation.
