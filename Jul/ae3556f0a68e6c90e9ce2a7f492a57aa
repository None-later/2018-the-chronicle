 HOSTS Mauritius complete the 2018 Cosafa Under-17 Championship semi-final line-up after Malawi failed to get the margin of victory they needed to end their Group C campaign as best runners-up yesterday. Malawi defeated eSwathini 1-0 to finish second in their pool with six points and a goal difference of +5. That is the same as Mauritius in Group A, but while Malawi scored six goals in their three matches, the islanders netted seven and so advance on goals scored to meet Group B winners South Africa in tomorrow’s semi-finals. It was heartbreak for the Young Flames, who had finished third in the last two competitions and saw their hopes of qualifying for the 2019 African Under-17 Championships dashed. Only the winner of the Cosafa competition will take their place in Tanzania next year, which in turn serves as a qualifier for the Fifa Under-17 World Cup in Peru later in the year. Malawi grabbed their goal through Lovemore Mbeta, but then had to withstand some heavy pressure from eSwathini to claim the win. eSwathini hit the post through Kendrik Maseko and also forced Malawi goalkeeper Kennedy Nankhaima into a number of fine saves. The Young Flames could not find the extra strike they needed and so bow out with their heads held high, but short of the semi-finals. Group C winners Angola made it three wins from three as they beat Zimbabwe 2-1 to inflict a third successive defeat on the Young Warriors. David Nzanza and AbdoulBarri had Angola 2-0 up, but Zimbabwe were brought back into the game by a strike from Tapiwa Mandinyenya. The semi-final line-up sees South Africa take on Mauritius at the Stade St Francois Xavier, with the latter seeking to feature in a second successive final. It is a repeat of last year’s semi-final that was won 2-0 by Mauritius. Namibia will take on Angola at the same venue in the second semi-final. Namibia were the 2016 winners, but Angola have had the best record in the pool stages as the only side to win all three of their matches. Yesterday’s results Group C Swaziland 0 Malawi 1 (Lovemore Mbeta). Zimbabwe 1 (Tapiwa Mandinyenya) Angola 2 (David Nzanza, AbdoulBarri).
