 Sikhumbuzo Moyo in Tsholotsho BINGA High School will play host to the Matabeleland North National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) inter-district chess championship which is meant to select a provincial team that will represent the province in the national finals set for Bulawayo next month. Speaking on the sidelines of the 2018 provincial athletics finals at Mavela High School in Tsholotsho yesterday, Head-in-charge of Chess in Matabeleland North, Tirison Cheteni from Pashu High School in Binga, said the provincial finals will be held from March 13-16. “These championships will be to select our provincial team for the national finals set for Bulawayo from April 4-7. We are confident that we will come up with a strong team that will stand its ground against other players in the national finals,” said Cheteni. He said the sport was gaining popularity in the province but two districts, Lupane and Nkayi, were still lagging behind in terms of the game. “My wish as the head in charge is to have a qualified chess instructor, more equipment and an arbiter per school which will help in promoting the sport even more. With a bit of determination from schools I am sure this is an achievable wish,” said Cheteni, who is also the Nash chairperson for Binga district. An arbiter is a person who officiates in a game of chess. Cheteni said the province came fourth in the 2017 national finals which were held in the capital, an indication that the province was a rising giant in the game. “We are no longer a province that participates in national finals merely for the sake of making up numbers but we are a province of note. If those things I said are needed are implemented I am positive in the not so distant future Matabeleland North province will become the top chess playing province in the country,” said Cheteni.
