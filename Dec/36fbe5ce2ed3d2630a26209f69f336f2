MORE than 120 players took part in the Emakhandeni Tennis Open for Under-10, 12, 14 and 18 held at Emakhandeni Tennis Club and Girls College from last Friday to Sunday. The event was meant to develop tennis players from previously marginalised areas. Munashe Bera (14) was victorious in the girls’ Under-18 category by overcoming Zandile Mguni 6-2, 6-4. In the boys’ category, Shane Tapera (14) from Prince Edward High in Harare beat Zamani Moyo from Emakhandeni Secondary School 6-3, 6-3. The Under-18 winners walked away with trophies and medals courtesy of sponsors, Pretoria Portland Cement (PPC). Five-year-old Sibusiso Sibanda from Emakhandeni Primary School got a bronze medal in Under-10 boys’ category. Sibanda secured a silver medal in the Tomasick Foundation tournament held at Emakhandeni last month. Emakhandeni Tennis Club chairperson Witness Jiyane said: “As part of resuscitating the club (Emakhandeni Tennis Club) we came up with this initiative whereby we invite players from all parts of the country to bring us competitiveness. This is the third year whereby we have managed to host 120 participants, resulting in us using Girls College as an additional venue for convenience. “We were expecting around 80 players to enter the contest, but the turnout was overwhelming and all thanks to our sponsors, who made this a success.”
