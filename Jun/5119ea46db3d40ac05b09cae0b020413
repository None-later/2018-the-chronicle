 Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter A TEACHER in Lupane has been arrested for allegedly having an affair with a Grade 7 pupil, police confirmed yesterday. The matter came to light last week when the 13-year-old girl visited a clinic to acquire family planning tablets. McDonald Mungati (44) of Lake Alice Primary School, Gwamba area under Chief Mabhikwa, alleges that he proposed love to the girl (name withheld for ethical reasons) on December 7, 2017, and she accepted. The two have been having an affair since then. Matabeleland North police spokesperson Inspector Siphiwe Makonese confirmed the incident. She said the suspect was being charged with contravening Section 70 of the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act Chapter 9.23 (having sexual intercourse with a minor). “A 44-year-old man was arrested for having sexual intercourse with a minor. He claimed to be having an affair with the girl since December 2017. “The matter came to light after the minor went to their local clinic where she asked for family planning pills, literally meaning she was having unprotected sex. “Nurses on duty quizzed her until she told them about the affair. Her mother was informed and the matter was reported to the police and the suspect was arrested,” said Insp Makonese. A source close to investigations said the matter was set for trial on June 14 and the accused is remanded at Lupane Prisons. The suspect, who divorced his wife years ago, works with the minor’s mother. “When the minor constantly visited Mungati at his cottage, her mother assumed that she was being assisted with school work,” said the source. @winnie_masara
