 Sports Reporter FOURTEEN teams have registered for the Bulawayo Metropolitan Rugby Football Board (BMRFB) Sevens Series that kicks off at the weekend. The teams will compete in three categories, senior men, Under-21 and women, whose games will be played simultaneously. Matabeleland Warriors and Highlanders will each field three teams; two in the senior men’s category and one in the Under-21s, while Old Miltonians and Bulldogs have each registered a senior team and an Under-21 side. Zambezi Diggers will have two teams; a senior men and women’s side, with Nyambose fielding a ladies’ team. Victoria Falls’ Trojans have registered an Under-21 team. BMRFB spokesperson Simba Dangah, who is also the fixtures convener, said the games will be played over four weekends, with the final set for March 3. He said they will use the competition to identify players for the provincial teams, the Cheetahs and the Goshawks. “Following the end of the BMRFB Under-21 tournament, we are getting into the Sevens Series, which promises to be an exciting period. What makes it more exciting, especially for players, is the prospect of being selected for the Goshawks and Cheetahs’ camps set for next month,” said Dangah. After the BMRFB Sevens Series, the provincial select will compete in an Inter-City Sevens tournament on March 10 followed by a Goshawks and Cheetahs camp the following weekend. The Sevens Series is a build-up to the Kwese Sevens to be held on March 24.
