Nicholas Singo Mehluli Sibanda, Senior Sports Reporter FIVE schools from Bulawayo will benefit from expert coaching from the teams that will be based in the city as part of the International Cricket Council Cricket World Cup Qualifier legacy. The five schools that have been identified by Zimbabwe Cricket are Milton Junior, Josiah Chinamano, Magwegwe, Mgiqika and Malindela. Under the Cricket for Good initiative which is a partnership between United Nations Children Fund and ICC, the five teams that will be based in the city for the group stage fixtures will choose any of the schools where they will conduct coaching clinics and cultural exchange programmes.  Cricket for Good reflects ICC’s commitment to the Spirit of Cricket, which is to use the popularity of the sport for social good. Nicholas Singo, the Bulawayo Metropolitan Cricket Association administrator confirmed the development, stating that the schools were chosen based on their active participation in the sport. Singo indicated that the National Association of Primary Heads also had an input in identifying the schools to benefit. “The schools were proposed by Naph by participation and those that are under privileged. This is not to say others are not active, they had to make sure that almost each district is represented as well,’’ said Singo. Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, Hong Kong, Scotland and runners up from the ICC World Cricket League Division Two, will play their group matches in Bulawayo from 4 to 12 March. Meanwhile, the Bulawayo Junior Council will carry out a cleanup exercise on Saturday. The sprucing up of the city’s streets is in conjunction with Zimbabwe Cricket and the Bulawayo Metropolitan Cricket Association. Invites have been sent out to football clubs, Highlanders, Bulawayo City and Chicken Inn to be part of the cleaning up with the Bulawayo Metropolitan Tuskers players also expected to participate. The clean up will start at Queens Sports Club and spread to other parts of the city. — @Mdawini_29
