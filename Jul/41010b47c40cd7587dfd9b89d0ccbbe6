 Sukoluhle Ndlovu, Midlands Correspondent GWERU City Council (GCC) says it needs about $10 million to fund the installation of prepaid water meters which it hopes will improve its revenue inflows. The local authority is owed more than $50 million in unpaid rates and water bills by both residents and companies. The council’s communications and public relations manager, Mr Manford Gambiza, said council resolved to install prepaid water meters two years ago but lack of funding has been the major stumbling block. “ We need at least $10 million for this project and efforts are underway to raise the required funding,” he said. Mr Gambiza said once installed, residents will pay for the water in advance and council will be deducting what it is owed each time the defaulters pay for water. He said as part of measures to recover the outstanding amount, council was asking defaulters who include residents and companies to come up with payment plans. “Many of the defaulters who have submitted payment plans have started reducing their arrears which is a positive development,” said Mr Gambiza. He urged those companies and residents yet to submit their payment plans to do so immediately. “We are also urging those residents and companies yet to submit their payment plans to come forward,” said Mr Gambiza. Kwekwe and Shurugwi councils have installed prepaid water meters and are already enjoying improved revenue inflows.
