 Michelle Gwizi, Court Reporter TWO men have been sentenced to nine years in prison for stock theft following their arrest at a roadblock where they were found in possession of a carcass of a cow they had stolen and slaughtered in Insuza. The two pleaded guilty before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Nyaradzo Ringisai who sentenced each of them to nine years in prison. On August 4 this year, Lungisani Sibanda (30) and Wellington Sibanda (30) boarded an Isuzu pick up truck after committing the crime but ran into problems when they were stopped by the police at a roadblock at the 81km peg along the Bulawayo -Victoria Falls road. A carcass and some meat were found in the vehicle.â€”@gwizi_n
