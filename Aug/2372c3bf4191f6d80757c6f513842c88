Advocate Nelson Chamisa EDITOR — Chamisa’s continued undemocratic utterances have now fully exposed him as a confused and desperate little politician. Zimbabweans spoke through the ballot box and chose Zanu-PF to continue governing this country. Chamisa has no locus standi to change the people`s verdict as the court will definitely disabuse him. If he is confident and believes his petition is water tight, why all the continued confused political barking, sober Zimbabweans are asking? The world is watching him, the world accepted the elections were free and fair, the world is impressed by Zimbabwe`s road to Damascus journey led by ED. Any foolish political gymnastics by this political novice will not change our nation`s trajectory towards improved lives for Zimbabweans. Zimbabweans love their peace and unity. We will not be misled by confused and unpatriotic politicians who continue to support sanctions in a desperate hope to leverage their political fortunes. Nehanda forbid. Cde Mzvinavhu  This Chamisa guy is the instrument being used by Mugabe to “destabilise the country” as he promised to do early this year. We will continue praying to God that such people are not even given the chance to rule the country again. However, ED was already given the path to follow and he knew it beforehand that he was yet to get the actual test. He knew that God wants him to unite and bring peace to the nation. ED will continue preaching peace and love while others try to cause chaos. Long live our President ED. God is with you in these trying times. Don’t lose focus, we are almost there and surely we will be there. God bless Zimbabwe. Tendai Ruvarashe
