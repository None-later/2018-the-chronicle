 Codelia Mondela, Court Reporter A POLICE officer from Bulawayo has appeared in court for allegedly destroying his live-in girlfriend’s cell-phone following a misunderstanding. Resten Mukumbiri (31) stationed at Donnington Police Station became violent and forcefully threw Joana Masango’s cell-phone valued at $125, against a wall. Mukumbiri was not asked to plead to malicious damage to property charges when he appeared briefly before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Sthembiso Ncube, who remanded the matter to July 3. Prosecuting, Mr Tawurai Hondoyemoto alleged that the two had a misunderstanding at around 6.30AM at their place of residence at Ross Camp. “Mukumbiri became violent towards Masango and he picked up her Huawei p8 lite cell-phone which she had placed on the bed. Mukumbiri smashed it against the wall and it got damaged,” the prosecutor said. “The value of the damaged cell-phone is $125 and was not restored. Accused person acted unlawfully.” @MondelaC
