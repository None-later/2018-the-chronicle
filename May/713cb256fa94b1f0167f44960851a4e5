Tobias Mandoreba in Hwange THE 2018 edition of the Binga Kasambezi Marathon will be held at the fishing resort town’s Freedom Square on Saturday under the theme “Unpacking various opportunities through sporting excellence and cultural resuscitation in the Zambezi Valley — Running for healthy lifestyle and fun”. Binga Kasambezi Marathon organising committee vice-president Recent Ncube said all was set for the marathon, which is now in its second year. “This is a brainchild of the Ministry of Sport, Arts and Recreation. In 2017, around 200 athletes participated and it was supported by the community through registration fees and a few t-shirts from stakeholders that were used as prizes,” said Ncube. “This time around, through the advice of the Sports and Recreation Commission, the event will be conducted in a festive manner whereby a number of activities will be exhibited, with the main event being the marathon. People can enter the 3km and 5km fun runs as well as the 10km, 21km and 42km. In addition, we will also have soccer, netball and traditional games.” Ncube said the event will also be used to promote mass participation in sport, talent identification and preparations for the 2018 National youth games and Econet Victoria Falls Marathon as well as to promote healthy lifestyles. Econet Wireless has chipped in to assist in the marathon by donating 500 t-shirts, while its subsidiary Kwese TV offered 10 decoders and free installation as part of the prizes. Agribank poured in $500 and t-shirts, with Total Service Station (Binga) donating $500 and fuel for logistics. Binga-born sporting legend Robson Mulombe, who represented Zimbabwe in the Japan Olympic Games in 1964, will be the guest of honour. After the event, delegates will tour Ba Tonga Museum, hot springs, sand beaches and also enjoy boat cruises. @tobymandox
