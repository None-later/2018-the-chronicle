Ayanda Wenzile Nkomo Showbiz Correspondent A 16-YEAR-OLD Dominican Convent School pupil in Bulawayo, Ayanda Wenzile Nkomo, has penned two books – My lover my destroyer and Words without actions and will launch them on Saturday. The launch will be held at The Homestead corner 4th Avenue and George Silundika Street from 2PM. During the launch there will be performances from her friends Rukudzo Tanyanyiwa and Rocker Sisters. Nkomo said the books were about bitterness, betrayal, heartbreak, love and empowerment. “I’ve been passionate about writing from a young age and telling stories. So these books are just my thoughts on bitterness, betrayal, heartbreak, love and empowerment. I haven’t experienced many of these but I’m a good observer and seen them from people around me,” said Nkomo. She said writing the books was not the hard part but publishing was tough. Nkomo thanked Billionaire Publishers owned by Marshal Chiza, another young writer, for helping her out. “Anyone can write a book with ease. The trouble starts when you want to publish. It’s difficult for someone to get a publishing house to publish their book. Marshal Chiza was the one who helped me as he had heard about my writing from a friend. He took a look at my work and what I wanted to do with it and liked it. He then helped me with everything,” said Nkomo who was accompanied by her mother Duduzile Dube. Dube said she was proud of her daughter for writing and publishing her books. “I’m just astounded by my daughter’s achievement and I’ll support her through and through. It was her aunt who noticed her talent from a young age and pointed it out to us. Now she’s come of age,” she said. Besides writing, Dube said her daughter was passionate about music and also wants to pursue a career in the film industry. “She aspires to reanimate the film industry of Zimbabwe as to improve the arts of her land. She’s a young girl that strives to be the best through all the tribulations even in her academics.”
