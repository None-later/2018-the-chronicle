Twitter Response to “EU, Zanu-PF call for peace” Opposition parties should face reality, ED won. Now it’s every Zimbabwean’s responsibility to help him build the nation we all want. — @Tichaona. Response to ‘‘ED Pfee’ as 2nd Republic is born” It was not easy, the opposition tried every trick in their book to sabotage ED. I am glad that ED is officially the new President. People will see that the best is yet to come. — @YollandaFadzai. Response to “Zim will be great again: Chiwenga” This is just the beginning of great things for this nation to prosper.
