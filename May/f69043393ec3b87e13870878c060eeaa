Sam Dzvimbu Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter SPORTS and Recreation Commission (SRC) Bulawayo provincial coordinator Sam Dzvimbu says 70 people took part in the Level 1 Sports Administration course held at Eveline High School at the weekend. The course was the first of many aimed at ensuring that all sports administrators hold SRC certificates to lead any sport organisation. “We are very happy with the turnout for this programme. We had people coming from around the country and two participants from Botswana. We are already making plans to have a Level 2 course for this class before the end of the year,” said Dzvimbu. “Very soon the SRC will make it a prerequisite for any aspiring sports administrator to hold a basic certificate from the commission to be able to lead any sporting board or club. “We know that sporting bodies do have their own courses, but it is equally important that those aspiring to be in administrative positions are trained by the SRC to ensure smooth governance.” Deputy director in the Ministry of Sport, Arts and Recreation Isaiah Mpofu, Bhekuzulu Khumalo from the Nust Sports Science department and Dzvimbu facilitated the course. The course covered changing trends affecting the sporting industry; the history of Zimbabwean sport from the colonial era to post independence, developments that led to the establishment of the SRC, how to run a sports club and long term athletes’ development. Participants were expected to understand how to identify and nurture talent, sports management, marketing, doping and safe sport, communication, risk management and understanding the SRC and its structures. The SRC will also be conducting courses on sports medicine and event management in the coming months. @innocentskizoe
