 Business Reporter The groundbreaking Ecobank mobile app, a single, unified financial services application across 33 African countries, has processed nine million transactions worth over $1 billion since launch less than 18 months ago, the bank has said. With over four million users, the Ecobank mobile app enables users to open an Ecobank Xpress account instantly on their mobile device, providing an easy route to financial inclusion for the previously unbanked. “There are now over four million Ecobank Xpress account holders on the Ecobank mobile app and USSD platforms. Other bank customers may onboard the Ecobank mobile app with their MasterCard or Visa cards while Ecobank customers do so using their card or retail internet banking credentials,” said the bank in a statement. Users of the Ecobank mobile app are able to transfer money instantly within Ecobank locally or across Africa using Ecobank rapid transfer, a unique service that is faster and more affordable than competing options. Consumers may also make transfers to other local bank accounts, mobile wallets and to Visa card holders using Visa direct on the Ecobank mobile App. The app offers easy payments . . . and has options to pay utility bills, school fees, subscriptions, donations, buying airtime instantly and generating payment tokens using Ecobank Xpress cash to do cardless ATM withdrawals. Group chief executive, Ade Ayeyemi, said Ecobank’s strategic mission was built around using mobile banking to deliver innovative, efficient and cost-effective services to those who have typically sat outside of the formal economy. The bank’s strategy, therefore, goes beyond the reach of the traditional branch and ATM networks. “Customers can enjoy 24/7/365 access to financial services from the convenience of their mobile devices with the Ecobank Mobile App,” he said. “We have brought world-class functionality to consumers in the 33 countries in Africa where Ecobank operates.”
