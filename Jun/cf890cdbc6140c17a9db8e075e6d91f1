 Nigeria v Iceland (17.00) Having pulled off one of the shocks of the opening round of fixtures at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™, Iceland will be hoping for all three points against Nigeria at the Volgograd Arena on Friday. In their opening match of Group D, the fearless tournament debutants managed to hold Argentina to a 1-1 draw thanks to a compact and hard-working collective performance. When an unnerved Lionel Messi missed a penalty that could have won the game, the Icelanders visibly grew in confidence and now Heimir Hallgrimsson’s side are in with a decent chance of qualifying for the Round of 16. On the other hand, Nigeria go into this fixture under significant psychological pressure, as defeat would consign them to an early exit from the tournament. Gernot Rohr’s team were unconvincing in their first match in Russia, when they looked predictable in attack and less than assured defending set pieces in a fully deserved 2-0 reverse to Croatia. Meanwhile, Iceland’s players will be allowed to have sex ahead of their Soccer World Cup match against Nigeria, as long as it’s with their wives, coach Heimir Hallgrimsson said yesterday. According to the Reuters website, when an Icelandic reporter asked if sex was banned for members of the squad, Iceland captain Aron Gunnarsson said, laughing: “For the time being, yes.” Hallgrimsson interjected: “At least as long as the wives have not arrived. No, sex is not banned, it’s bulls***.” Iceland’s final group stage match is against Croatia on Tuesday, June 26. — Fifa-com-Sport24.
