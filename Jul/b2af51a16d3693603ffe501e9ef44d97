 Every year Shangani Heights farmers lose their cattle due to poaching.  Poachers looted all the wild animals in this area. Now they are on track of the few surviving ones using traps,  especially in the area called eMadamu. I urge all farmers to take serious measures on this issue by making sure that their workers are not taking part in this dirty practice. I would like to thank Mr Kunene’s worker, Mdawini, for  removing some of the wire used as traps. Emadamu is a good grazing area but now it has turned to be a very dangerous place to let cattle go. Farmers open up your eyes on this issue. — Nyoni, Shangani Heights What Presidential candidates promise – no cheers for the elderly with their Zim$ plights still unsolved.  We appeal for the uncompleted and promised compensation to be effected to ease their plight. — Concerned Pensioner
