Sithethelelwe ‘Kwinji 15’ Sibanda Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter MIGHTY Warriors coach Sithethelelwe “Kwinji 15” Sibanda will soon call more players into camp in addition to the squad that travelled for a friendly against Mozambique as part of preparations for the upcoming Cosafa Cup set for South Africa. This year’s championship will run from September 12-23 in the neighbouring country after being successfully hosted in Bulawayo last year when the Mighty Warriors lost 1-2 to South Africa in a jam packed final at Barbourfields Stadium. “We will be calling more players into camp for training although I am yet to discuss our programme with the office,” said Sibanda after returning home from Mozambique where her girls prevailed 6-2. She had hastily called up an 18-member squad comprising a mixture of old and new faces. Mavis Chirandu scored a brace, while Erina Jeke, Marjory Nyaumwe, Maudy Mafuruse and Concilia Madotsa each found the net in their demolition of Mozambique. While Zimbabwe are yet to finalise their Cosafa Cup roadmap, countries like Botswana and Zambia have already called up their provisional squads for the tournament, with Chipolopolo going into camp at the beginning of last month. The Botswana squad is made up of largely teenage players, as they want to build a team for the future and Zimbabwe would do well to take a leaf from the zebras, as most players are now in their twilight years.
