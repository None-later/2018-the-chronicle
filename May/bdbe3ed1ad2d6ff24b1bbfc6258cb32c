 Mehluli Sibanda in Esigodini KYLE College of Masvingo contributed the majority of the Old Mutual Zimbabwe Under-18 rugby side for the Academy Week in South Africa with five players in the 23-member squad. The squad was announced after a two-day trial at Falcon College in Esigodini on Saturday. Four players were called up from St George’s College of Harare, followed by Prince Edward with three, St John’s College (three), while Falcon, Peterhouse and Heritage each contributed two. Six non-travelling reserves were named; two each from Falcon and St George’s, while Churchill High and Prince Edward have one each. With Zimbabwe no longer part of the Under-18 Craven Week, the country is now sending just one team for that age group to South Africa. The Academy Week will be at Paarl Boys High together with the Craven Week from July 8-14 as part of the school’s 150th anniversary celebrations. The national Under-16 team for the Grant Khomo Week was also selected at Falcon, while the Under-13 squad was picked at trials conducted at Heritage School in Harare. The Under-13 Craven Week and Under-16 Grant Khomo Week will be held at Hoërskool Diamantveld in Kimberley from July 1-6.
