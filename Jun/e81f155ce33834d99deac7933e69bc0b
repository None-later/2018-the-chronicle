Brazilian Samba dancers at last year’s carnival Walter Mswazie, Showbiz Correspondent PREPARATIONS for the popular Harare International Carnival set to run from 17 July to 21 are well on course. Last year’s carnival saw a number of groups including the Samba Queens from Brazil parading on the streets of Harare. Thousands of people witnessed the annual funfair with more expected to attend this year’s edition. Zimbabwe Tourism Authority head of corporate affairs, Godfrey Koti whose organisation is behind the hosting of the event, said preparations were going on well. He said given the improved relations with the international community that Zimbabwe now enjoys, more than 50 groups are expected to participate at this year’s event. “More details of the carnival programme will be availed in due course but what is definite is that this year’s carnival will be bigger and better compared to previous years,” said Koti. Last year more than 20 countries participated at the event which ran under the theme: “One Love, Our Pride.” Rhumba star Werrason from (DRC), Dr Malinga and Uhuru, both from South Africa, also performed. @walterbmswazie2
