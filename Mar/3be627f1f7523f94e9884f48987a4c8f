During a campaign spearheaded by Skyz Metro FM last week to get him a replacement, South Africa-based Maskandi singer Zinjaziyamluma donated one while the other the guitar came from a well-wisher who declined to be named. The blind singer also received a brand new keyboard sourced by businesspeople who operate at Pioneer House. A short presentation ceremony was held at his base at Pioneer House where National Gallery of Zimbabwe regional director, Voti Thebe, handed over the guitars. Skyz Metro FM was represented by Vuka Vuka Breakfast show host Babongile Sikhonjwa, the station manager Godwin Phiri and Rea Vaya drive time presenter BKay. Phiri said the second guitar will be used by Taffi to practice at home while the other one from Zinjaziyamluma will be used for his performances. Receiving the donations,Taffi said he was at a loss for words. “I don’t know what to say. People have showed their love after some despair in my life when the guitar I was using for making money was stolen. Now I have two guitars and a keyboard. “I’m happy and would like to thank everyone who helped me,” said Taffi. Thebe said the act of donating the guitars showed brotherly love. “This shows that people from Bulawayo have others at heart as they came to the party to help Dube in his time of need. They should continue demonstrating such love,” said Thebe. Taffi briefly demonstrated his skills with one of the new guitars much to the amusement of those that had gathered to witness the donation presentation.
