Dr Thokozani Khupe Harare Bureau The MDC-T faction led by Dr Thokozani Khupe yesterday rapped Mr Nelson Chamisa’ supporters for their violent behaviour during a Supreme Court hearing on Tuesday. Addressing journalists in Harare yesterday, party spokesperson Ms Linda Masarira said the heckling of Dr Khupe and violent behaviour by Chamisa’s supporters at the superior court showed that the faction did not only have respect for the rule of law but also the judiciary. The statement followed violent scenes perpetrated by supporters of Mr Chamisa during a Supreme Court hearing in which the latter was appealing against a High Court decision allowing Dr Khupe and her followers to use the opposition party’s logo and emblem. The case has since been referred back to the High Court to determine the legitimate successor of the late Morgan Tsvangirai. “The attack on president Thokozani Khupe and our party members yesterday is criminal and unlawful. The acts of violence that happened in front of the most powerful criminal court in the country tells a story of the attitude towards the institutions of law,” said Ms Masarira. She said Chamisa’s supporters had a penchant for violence and that was an indictment of an impunity mind-set. Ms Masarira implored law enforcement agencies to identify the culprits and bring them to book. “The identity of the perpetrators is known or at the very least is ascertained by video evidence, it is clear they are not Zanu-PF supporters but of Nelson Chamisa,” said Ms Masarira. “We appeal to the law enforcement and the criminal justice system to ensure the safety of all Zimbabweans ahead of the watershed elections.” During the hearing, members believed to be from the Chamisa led faction were seen booing and heckling Dr Khupe and her fellow members while they were leaving the Supreme Court. The MDC Chamisa group subjected Dr Khupe to derogatory chants of ‘’h*re! h*re! (prostitute! prostitute!).
