In his inaugural speech on November 24, 2017, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe was open for investment from all countries of the world, as part of measures implemented by his Government to stimulate economic growth. Radiant Lighting, which operates in several African countries that include Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa and Mauritius seized the opportunity to expand its business into Zimbabwe.

He said Nations Hardware and Electrical was pleased to be able to bring such an iconic brand to Zimbabwe, which is found across most homes and business in most African countries.
