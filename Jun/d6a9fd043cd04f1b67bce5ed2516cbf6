 Cape Town — For some reason, artiste Yoko Ono posted a World Cup prediction all the way back on Valentine’s Day in 2017. And, in all honesty, it didn’t make much sense. The now-85-year-old widow of Beatles superstar John Lennon didn’t actually pick a team, but rather took to Twitter to suggest that “a child who believes in a peaceful world” would be the one to lift the World Cup trophy in Moscow on July 15, 2018. Not Germany, or Brazil, or Spain … but a peaceful child. At the time, nobody paid much attention to the tweet, but it has become the punchline of some rather humorous Twitter banter over the past couple of weeks. Some of the response, as listed below, have been world class. Here are some of our favourites. — Sport24.
