Kelvin Madzongwe Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter CHAMPIONS FC Platinum’s new acquisition Kelvin Madzongwe says he is ready to make a comeback after spending six months on the sidelines when his intended move to Harare City from Bulawayo City in the 2017 mid-season transfer window in July fell through. He was also linked with a move to Highlanders, but again nothing materialised until he was snapped up by FC Platinum, as the Zvishavane side beefed its squad for the gruelling Caf Champions League, which they embark on next month. Gifted with good ball control, the combative Madzongwe is looking forward to his debut in the African safari. “I am very happy to be here; this is a big club with big players and l am ready for the challenge. l have not played for six months, but in that time l was working hard and keeping myself in shape and l am adapting well to my new colleagues. It’s a new challenge for me and l am hoping to learn a lot here and at the same time develop as a player. I am thrilled with the prospect of playing in the Caf Champions League, it’s a dream come true. Hopefully l will be able to help the team as much as l can,” said the defensive midfielder. He will battle for a place in central midfield with the likes of Winston Mhango and Edwin Madhanhanga. Madzongwe has also played college football in the United States of America for Boston University, while studying for a Bachelor of Science Degree in Communications majoring in public relations and marketing. Before he went to the USA, Madzongwe had playing stints at the now defunct Njube Sundowns and Chicken Inn. He also played for Highlanders juniors and Sparrows in the Division Two League. @innocentskizoe
