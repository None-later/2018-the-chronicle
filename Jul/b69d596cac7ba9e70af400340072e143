 Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls ZIMBABWE has only 1 500 civil, mechanical, architectural and scientific engineers out of about 6 000 accredited professionals in the field. This emerged during the Zimbabwe Infrastructure Development Conference here on Tuesday where delegates raised concerns about shortage of engineers in the country as many have left the country for greener pastures. Zimbabwe Institute of Engineers president, Engineer Israel Rwodzi said the conference was meant to position engineers in the country’s economic revival drive towards a “Built Environment”, an economy based on infrastructure development. Eng Rwodzi said the role of engineers was critical in the context of a Zimbabwe that is open for business. “As investors are coming into the country, we can’t sit and not benefit the country. We want those who have left for greener pastures to return home and assist in the rebuilding of the economy,” he said. “We have 1 500 engineers in the country out of a possible 6 000 who are supposed to be in the country.” Eng Rwodzi said the country has trained enough engineers across all sectors but many had since left the country seeking greener pastures. He said these can return home once they are guaranteed jobs. Eng Rwodzi said under normal circumstances the country should have about 18 000 engineers but could do with 6 000. About 300 engineers including engineering consultants attended the conference which was officially opened by President Emmerson Mnangagwa      yesterday. Eng Rwodzi said the meeting was a special investment conference after the realisation that the country is going into a new phase that requires engineers to play a pivotal role. Among topical issues was the need to bolster training amid concerns that the calibre of students coming out of tertiary institutions were failing to make the grade in the industry. The conference ran under the theme: “Accelerated Infrastructure Investment, Development and Delivery. @ncubeleon
