 THE star attacking trio of Liverpool, Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane have broken an incredible Uefa Champions League record set by the ‘BBC’ of Real Madrid. Real Madrid’s domination in competition in recent years has often been down to the impressive strike force of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo. However, with their influence diminishing as head coach Zinedine Zidane moved away from a 4-3-3 system, a new trio has dazzled Europe. After Mane netted his ninth goal in the 4-2 second-leg defeat of their Uefa Champions League semi-final against AS Roma, it broke the goalscoring record from the infamous strike force, set in the 2013/14 campaign. With both Salah and Firmino netting 10 goals each, the 29 strikes between the Reds scintillating forwards is officially the highest scoring trio in a single Champions League campaign. Ironically, they will now meet Los Blancos in Kiev for the final, where they’ll have one more chance to further their remarkable achievement in Europe’s elite club competition. —KickOff
