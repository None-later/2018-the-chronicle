Cape Town – The Confederation of African Football (Caf) have invited Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane to take part in the Uefa Pro Licence which is set to take place in Morocco from 12 to 14 March. Mosimane has seen his stock rise in Africa in recent years after claiming the Champions League trophy in 2016. As such, Caf have extended a personal invitation to the 53-year-old to come and complete his licence. The qualification is regarded as the highest coaching badge available in world football and generally follows the completion of the Uefa ‘B’ and ‘A’ licences. Downs’ official website said: “Sundowns’ Caf Champions League campaign started on the good note with coach Pitso Mosimane receiving an invitation from Caf’s President Ahmad Ahmad to take part in the Pro Licence course that will be held in Rabat. “The Pro Licence is the highest qualification of football coaches and is part of the progressive logic for those who have already passed the Caf C, B and A licences. The course will run from March 12-14 in Morocco with eight modules and will be held during Fifa dates.” – Sport24.
