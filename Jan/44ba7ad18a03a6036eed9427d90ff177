Donald Mangenje Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe sevens rugby team, Zambezi Cheetahs, begin their 2018 World Cup preparations tomorrow when they assemble at Harare Sports Club for a two-day training camp. Zimbabwe is one of the best 24 sevens rugby teams that will compete in this year’s Rugby Sevens World Cup to be held in San Fransisco, United States of America from July 20-22. The Cheetahs will be joined by three other African countries, South Africa, Kenya and Uganda, in the tournament. Cheetahs’ manager Donald Mangenje said they expect about 40 players to attend tomorrow’s training camp. “The training camp is still on as planned and we have extended the invitation to local and international players because we want to give everyone a chance to make the squad. The aim is to assess the current state of our players in terms of skills and fitness and give the coach time to identify where we’re lacking,” said Mangenje. He said they had invited players based outside the country, such as McNab Matthew, who plies his trade in England. With less than six months remaining before the Sevens World Cup kicks off, the Cheetahs have lined up a number of preparatory tournaments to help the team gear up for the world show piece. The Cheetahs will have their first competition at the Royal Bafokeng tournament in South Africa from March 3-4. This will be followed by an encounter against Uganda in Kampala from March 16-17. The next preparations will be held in Victoria Falls from March 24-25 before the Hong Kong tournament from April 6-8. The Cheetahs’ last tournament will be in Mauritius from June 22-23. — @khumzallen
