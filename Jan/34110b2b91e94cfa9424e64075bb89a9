Cde Angeline Masuku Yemurai Ushamba, Chronicle Reporter ZIMBABWEANS should work together to rebuild the country so that it reclaims its bread basket status. The Minister of State for Provincial Affairs in Bulawayo Cde Angeline Masuku said this in a speech read on her behalf by Khami District Administrator, Mrs Beaula Gwaze at the burial of a war veteran, Cde Natsani Sibanda at the Bulawayo Provincial Heroes Acre on Friday. Cde Masuku said Zimbabweans should unite to develop the country. “Precisely everyone should work very hard to develop our beautiful Zimbabwe,” said Cde Masuku. “The new political dispensation calls for every Zimbabwean to work hard and bring back Zimbabwe’s state of being the breadbasket of Africa through reviving the economy and industry.” Cde Sibanda who crossed into Zambia to join the liberation struggle in 1977 died at the age of 57 on January 11 in Bulawayo. He was born in Dombodema, Bulilima district in 1960. Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans’ Association representative Cde Lazarus Nyoni said Cde Sibanda trained in Zambia. “He trained at Nampundu camp in Zambia and joined Zimbabwe Republic Police in 1980 and left in 1985 due to ill health,” he said. He extended his condolences to the family and urged all war veterans to write their own biographies. Mr Prince Sibanda, the late Cde Sibanda’s brother said the liberation war hero was an active member of the 12 Apostolic church and his death was a blow to the family. “He was a little stubborn and a very hard worker. He loved his family and despite staying far apart we have always supported each other,” he said. “ He loved his children and he has left a great void in the family that can never be filled.” @YUshamba
