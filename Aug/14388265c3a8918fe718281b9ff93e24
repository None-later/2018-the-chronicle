Dr Desire Sibanda Esinathy Sibanda, Chronicle Reporter THE Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development has urged all tertiary institutions to adhere to the new policy on payment of fees by students on attachment. The Ministry reviewed downwards the payment of tuition fees by students on industrial attachment or teaching practice to 60 percent of tuition fees. Previously students on attachment were required to pay the full fees. The Ministry said all institutions that had not adhered to the policy were mandated to do so with immediate effect. The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Dr Desire Sibanda, said they will carry out an audit to make sure that the policy is adopted by every institution. “We have decided to carry out an audit to make sure there is 100 percent compliance with the new policy. We have it on record from students that some of these institutions haven’t complied. We will deal with these institutions accordingly,” he said. Dr Sibanda rubbished messages circulating on social media that the Ministry has further slashed the tuition fees by 20 percent. In a recent statement, the Ministry said it had reviewed the payment of fees by students on attachment after taking careful consideration of the socio-economic environment and the status of the majority of the students. Students on attachment and teaching practice meet the cost of accommodation, food and transport to and from work. “This new policy abolished Circular No.6 of 1997 which required students on attachment to pay full fees. In this regard, the Ministry would like to express its gratitude to all institutions that had been able to implement this policy Circular No.2 of 2018 that enables the Ministry to promote industrial and practical practice,” said the Ministry in a statement. The National University of Science and Technology (Nust), Lupane State University and Midlands State University confirmed that they had complied with the directive. — @esinathy_essira
