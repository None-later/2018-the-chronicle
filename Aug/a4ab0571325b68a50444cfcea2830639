Dr Gerald Gwinji Thandeka Moyo, Chronicle Reporter THE Government has warned members of public against buying and using drugs from uncertified pharmacies or individuals saying it endangers life. The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health and Child Care, Retired Major General Dr Gerald Gwinji, said his office was aware of the influx of fake and expired medicines in circulation. “It is illegal and dangerous to market unregistered pharmaceuticals and sell any from unregistered premises. These include street pavements and market place products that are a threat to life,” he said. “People should stop putting their lives at risk by using such products. Some are fake or falsely labelled while some are expired”. Dr Gwinji said the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe was the only institution that certifies the sale of pharmaceuticals. “We will alert the Medicines Control Authority (MCAZ) of Zimbabwe to increase their monitoring so that criminals are brought to book,” he added. Some members of the public have resorted to buying medicines from street vendors and illegal suppliers whose prices are usually lower than those of pharmacies. MCAZ said it is equally concerned about the illicit importation and sale of medicines on the parallel market, including medicines being sold on the street. “The MCAZ carries out blitzes in conjunction with the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP), and works with the National Prosecuting Authority in prosecuting perpetrators. We carry out capacity building exercises which involve the training of our stakeholders on a regular basis. “We also have a dedicated enforcement team which moves around the country,” said the organisation. To date numerous arrests have been made of persons dealing in unregistered medicines and selling from unapproved premises. @thamamoe
