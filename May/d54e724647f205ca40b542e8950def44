 Langalakhe Mabena SKYZ Metro FM’s morning drive show Vuka Vuka celebrated 365 days of broadcasting on Saturday by hosting a family fun show at the Bulawayo Centre. The informative and educational show which touches on different issues that affect the Bulawayo community is anchored by rockstar Babongile Sikhonjwa, Master E and Donna N. The two hour programme airs from Monday to Friday starting from 8:00am to 10am on the 100.3 frequency. Sikhonjwa said credit should be given to the listeners who tune in every morning to listen to the most successful morning drive show in the city. “It’s an honour that Vuka Vuka breakfast show celebrated 365 days of broadcasting for the Bulawayo community on their radio of choice – Skyz Metro FM. We are what we are today because the community supports the programme. “Isititshi sabantu will continue to give Bulawayo quality programming like Vuka Vuka and most of the shows broadcast by the station,” said Sikhonjwa. As a way to accommodate diverse audiences, the family fun day which attracted a large number of listeners of different age groups, started at 2PM with a live broadcast. A lot of games and competitions were run with winners being given an assortment of prizes that varied from stationery to foodstuffs. Skyz Metro FM station manager Godwin Phiri said the turnout at the family fun show was a sign that the station had a lot of listenership in the city. “The number of people who attended the Vuka Vuka Breakfast show 365 days of broadcasting celebrations at Bulawayo Centre is a sign that we accommodate everyone in Bulawayo, from the young to the old and from different walks of life. “We’ll continue giving Bulawayo good quality broadcasts and maintain our standard as the leading commercial radio station in Bulawayo,” said Phiri. @langamabena
