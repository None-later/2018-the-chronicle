TRIANGLE United have expressed a desire to retain attacking midfielder Collins Duhwa on a permanent deal after he impressed the Sugar Boys on loan from Chicken Inn FC. Duhwa (26) was loaned out to Triangle United so that he gets game time after falling down the starting pack order. The attacking midfielder who joined Chicken Inn in July 2017 from Shabanie Mine seems to have charmed Triangle United coach Tawurayi Mangwiro as he played a key role in inspiring the Lowveld side to Chibuku Super Cup victory. Should Chicken Inn agree to Triangle United’s offer, then Duhwa, barring injuries will play in the 2019/20 Caf Confederations Cup. Chicken Inn secretary-general Tawengwa Hara confirmed that Triangle United have sent in an inquiry on having Duhwa on a permanent deal. “It is the technical team that will have to decide whether they need Duhwa back or not. Remember, Chicken Inn FC doesn’t stand on the way of players should they wish to move but that should be done above board. “Triangle United have inquired about the availability of Collins Duhwa but a decision is yet to be made. At the moment we are seized with pursuing players that the coaches had identified and we’re happy with the progress we’ve made by securing some of our targets,” said Hara. Chicken Inn have been busy on the market, strengthening their side before the end of the festive holidays. The Gamecocks have signed 24-year-old pair of striker Clive Augusto and midfielder Sipho Ndlovu, as well as 19-year-old Aces Youth Academy product Panashe Mutasa who turned out for Dynamos in the 2018 season. Augusto played for Ngezi Platinum Stars last season while Ndlovu was in the books of relegated Bulawayo City FC. Ngezi Platinum’s goalkeeper Donovan Bernard is reportedly interested in joining Chicken Inn even though he has a year left on his contract with the miners. — @ZililoR.
