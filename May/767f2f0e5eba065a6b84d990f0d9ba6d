Rodwell Dhlakama Lovemore Zigara in Gweru Chapungu 0 – 0 Chicken Inn AIRMEN Chapungu and visiting Chicken Inn shared the spoils in a dull goalless Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Ascot Stadium yesterday. Both teams’ sets of strikers forgot their shooting boots at home, with Chapungu’s duo of Allen Tavarwisa and Brighton Mugoni taking turns to miss sitters while George Majika and the ageless Obidiah Tarumbwa also took turns to miss. Chapungu assistant coach Clement Mugari was, however, content with the draw. “I am happy with the draw because it shows improvement on our part because we are coming from two consecutive defeats and for us this is something to carry forward. The boys have respondent to new coach Rodwell Dhlakama, who has brought in a sense of self belief and confidence to the team,” said Mugari. However, Chicken Inn’s Joey Antipas felt his charges could have converted the few chances they created. “It was always going to be a very difficult match, especially playing against a team with a new coach. However, I feel we had better chances and we could have buried one or two chances. For us it has been difficult to play at Ascot because we have just won once here. The surface is hard and we cannot play our normal game. Ascot is our hoodoo ground and we hope things will change in future,” said Antipas.
