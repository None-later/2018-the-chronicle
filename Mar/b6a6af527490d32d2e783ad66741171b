Dj Liz Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent THE concept was great but the delivery by some of the artistes and organisers was a letdown during the Gqom Life All White pool party that was held at Queens Sports Club on Saturday night. The show was to promote Black Diamondâ€™s album Gqom Life and also giving a platform to Bulawayo artistes to perform in front of a crowd. Most of the revellers who attended were youths. More than 20 artistes showcased their talent and most of them were hip hop musicians. The event which started at around 6PM was spoiled by a few artistes whose performance was lethargic. This in turn dampened the mood on the dance floor. There were too many artistes on the line up and as such they had limited time to perform. It was not a Gqom fiesta because just a handful of artistes performed the genre in particular Black Diamond who were promoting their album. Standout performance came from hip hop star Asaph, DJ Liz, dance group Antivirus, DJ Skaiva who alongside Leeknotic and one DJ Sweet Moby lit up the stage. Some like Indigo Saint could not perform because of technical problems with loading their music. Not all the DJs performed as there was a shortage of equipment such as CDJs (mixers) that were crucial. The champagne that was promised was given away to those in the VIP area but later there was not VIP area as it became a free for all. The organisers managed to build hype for the event and the weather was in their favour as it did not rain. The stage set up was good and so was the sound.
