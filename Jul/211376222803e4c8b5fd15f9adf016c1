Highlanders players celebrate Bosso at 90, how about writing a piece of the club’s history in book form? We really need it. We want to know how the Bulawayo giants fared all those years. We also want to know the history of the club’s soccer greats like the three Ndlovu brothers who won almost everything during their time at Highlanders. How the club was formed and who the first players for the team were. It would be enlightening. — Interested Fan. I am very much concerned about the lack of roadblocks along Victoria Falls Road. I am a motorist who drives almost every day from Bulawayo to Victoria Falls. There used to be four roadblocks on this road in the morning from 6am to 8.30am but there is nothing and motorists are driving ignoring all the road regulations. Sometimes you find someone driving a car without number plates, so what happens if that person has an accident and decides to speed away? Please help us. I know  police at roadblocks used to be a pain in the neck, but after reorientation of the police force can we have a few roadblocks on our roads to regulate traffic and monitor crime levels. A roadblock should be placed just after the Victoria Falls garage and thereafter one could be placed after every 100km. —  Concerned Motorist Thumbs up Marist Brothers Dete for a good performance in athletics. Your relays were swift and amazing. Keep up the good work.  – KK Dete I think the seasons have shifted. I challenge the government to employ scholars that will verify this so that our farmers can change their farming times,hence reduce chances of famine by planting well before the rains start. – The Engineer, City Of Kings
