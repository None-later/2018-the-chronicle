 Sylvester Chiramba, Court Reporter A SHEBEEN Queen from Bulawayo who allegedly stabbed her husband to death with a kitchen knife following a misunderstanding in Pumula suburb has appeared in court. Nomzamoluhle Dube (30) from Pumula suburb allegedly stabbed her husband Martin Ncube in the chest after the two had a misunderstanding in the early hours of Saturday. Dube allegedly hid the knife in a flower garden before trying to flee from the murder scene but was apprehended by neighbours who took her to the police station. She was not asked to plead to murder charges when she appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Lungile Ncube. The magistrate remanded her in custody to March 19 for a trial date to be set at the Regional court. Dube pleaded with the magistrate to be remanded out of custody saying she wanted to bury her husband. The magistrate advised her to apply for bail at the High Court. A source told The Chronicle that Ncube was buried yesterday in Bulawayo. In court, the prosecutor, Mrs Memory Ndlovu, said Dube stabbed her husband on the left side of the chest once with a kitchen knife after a misunderstanding at their place of residence in Pumula on Saturday morning. “Dube threw the murder weapon in a flower bed and was apprehended as she tried to flee the scene by neighbours who handed her over to the police,” she said. Neighbours told The Chronicle on Monday that Dube, who is popularly known as ‘Hlengiwe’ in the neighbourhood, allegedly runs a shebeen at her family house where she was staying with her husband. The neighbours said Dube allegedly killed her husband in the presence of their two children. @SlyCee10
