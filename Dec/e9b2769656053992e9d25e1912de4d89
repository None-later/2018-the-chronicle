FORMER Zifa Bulawayo Province board member Mkhululi Mthunzi says Zimbabwe needs a football indaba following the election of new Zifa national board. Mthunzi is optimistic that newly elected Zifa president Felton Kamambo will unite the country’s football fraternity, as the game needs healing following divisions that emerged during Phillip Chiyangwa’s tenure. “Football affects everyone in Zimbabwe, so are the problems related to it. As a result, it is high time we work as a nation and support the new leadership for the benefit of our football. The new leadership must work as a team and ensure the whole nation is served to avoid pointing of fingers when things get tough,” said Mthunzi. The Zifa pre-election period was drama-filled, with Kamambo being initially banned from contesting together with his new vice-president Gift Banda over an assortment of allegations. — @DecoDecent2
