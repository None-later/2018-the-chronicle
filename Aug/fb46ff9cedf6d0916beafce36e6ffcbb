NRZ building Editor — On behalf of hundreds of National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) employees we would like to congratulate the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Cde Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa and Zanu-PF for winning the just ended 2018 harmonised elections. I rarely make contributions to this column but suffice to say I have been activated by the never ending problems affecting NRZ workers. It appears no one is prepared to listen and workers are subject to unfair labour practices. Your coming into the office in November 2017 was well received by the majority of NRZ workers who hoped for better changes at the company. NRZ employees last received a full salary a couple of years back and are being owed two years’ salaries and management is not moved by that. Management has of late introduced a payment plan but they still find it difficult to honour their obligations. When they fail to pay workers as planned, no official communication is sent to the workers as if to say there is nothing wrong with that. These are the people who are entrusted with the running of such a key national institution. The problems at NRZ have nothing to do with operational challenges but are a result of poor management systems. NRZ employees are totally demoralised and look to the President to intervene.
