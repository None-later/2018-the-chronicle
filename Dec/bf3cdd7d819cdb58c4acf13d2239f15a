EMAKHANDENI Tennis Club’s 15-year-old player Zamani Moyo will participate in the New Winners Tournament that starts in Harare today. Moyo claimed silver in an Under-18 tennis championship in Mutare on Monday after losing to the host city’s Anesu Kwirirayi. The Mutare championship director Vincent Nyatoti described Moyo as a talented young man who has a great future. He said despite being outclassed in the final, the young Emakhandeni star will have a big say in the Harare event. “He (Moyo) did well here in Mutare and his talent is unquestionable. “Coming all the way from Bulawayo to play with such confidence is something extraordinary and he can build his career on what he has already achieved,” said Nyatoti. Earlier this month, Moyo lost the final of the Emakhandeni Tennis Open to Shane Tapera (14) from Harare’s Prince Edward High. Emakhandeni Tennis Club chairperson Witness Jiyane said they were happy with Moyo’s progress and hoped he would fare well in the capital. “We’re optimistic he will record positive results in the upcoming competitions with the guidance of his coach. Ever since he joined the club in 2014, he never looked back and has even represented Zimbabwe on the international stage,” said Jiyane. Moyo represented Zimbabwe in the 2016 legs of the African Junior Championships in Botswana and South Africa. —@DecoDecent2
