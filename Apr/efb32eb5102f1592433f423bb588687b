BRYCE Easton overturned the 73 he signed for in the third round of the Zimbabwe Open in spectacular fashion when he shot an unblemished nine-under-par 63 final round to equal the course record and claim victory at the Royal Harare Golf Club yesterday. He finished the third round with a double-bogey on 17 and a bogey on 18 in round three and admitted that he was quite gutted by his display which left him six shots behind the leading JC Ritchie. However, in the final round, Easton came out guns blazing, opening his final round with three birdies on the trot before a par halted him on the fourth. Four holes later he was seven-under-par, with birdies on the fifth, the sixth, a par on the seventh, another birdie on eight and a par to turn in 30. By this time, it was clear that he would either take the round to a play-off with a few other players who included Ritchie who led for the entire week. “I felt like I played well for most of the week, even yesterday,” he said, “but, yesterday was a little off. I just finished poorly. But, I went out there with a different mindset and maybe that helped me, being a little bit behind going out today.” He admits, however, that he didn’t have a problem chasing the leaders, and not being the one being chased. “It is a different ball game when you’re in front because you get the attention from the get-go,” he said, “maybe, being a few behind the pace was what I needed to do.” On the homeward stretch, Easton needed to be calm to be able to protect the gains he had made, but he also knew he needed to make more gains to pull clear of the group that occupied the first few spots on the leaderboard. He did so expertly, making a birdie on the 10th. He made two more birdies on holes 14 and 16 to get to nine-under 63 and remain within touching distance of claiming a third win on the Sunshine Tour. “I gave myself chances,” Easton said, “You’ve got to roll in the putts, one, to shoot 63, and two to win a golf tournament, and I putted great today, and obviously I hit it well and gave myself chances but I knocked them in, which is the difference.” Easton will now look forward to the next few events on the schedule with some confidence and will be happy to start the season right up there on the Order of Merit.
