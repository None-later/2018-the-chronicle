Cde Pupurai Togarepi Nyemudzai Kakore, Harare Bureau The Zanu-PF Youth League yesterday strongly condemned violence that occurred in Harare on Thursday night in which two people died and several others were injured while property worth thousands of dollars was damaged. Addressing a press conference in the capital yesterday, the Youth League secretary Cde Pupurai Togarepi said the violence was politically motivated. Two vehicles were reduced to shells while Harare Central Police Station was stoned and heavily damaged by a rowdy mob. The mayhem followed a directive by Harare City Council stopping commuter omnibus operators and on-street vendors from conducting their business in the CBD. “Zanu-PF Youth League registers its displeasure over the incidences of violence which rocked Harare yesterday (Thursday),” said Cde Togarepi. “We urge the police force to apprehend the culprits. Our preliminary investigations revealed that an organised cartel of some hoodlums sponsored by a certain political party took advantage of the situation and orchestrated violence which led to the destruction of public and private property.” Cde Togarepi said violence should not be tolerated under the new administration led by President Emmerson Mnangagwa. He said the new dispensation was for peace, love, unity and non-violence. “This behaviour by yet to be apprehended hoodlums is against the call for non-violence by President Emmerson Mnangagwa,” he said. “The loss of life in the incident is regrettable and the conduct by an organised syndicate of criminal elements who caused havoc in the CBD should be condemned in totality,” he said. “We are aware that violence is the order of the day in certain political parties and this should never be exported to national politics. Zimbabwe is a peace loving nation and we urge all parties to embrace the call for peace by our President.”
