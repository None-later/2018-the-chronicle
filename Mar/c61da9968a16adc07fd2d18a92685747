This is a key milestone on our digital journey as a bank and underlines our commitment to investing and growing in the market. “Digitising Africa remains at the heart of our business strategy for the region, and we look to implement our Côte d’Ivoire model across other markets in the coming months,” he said. The bank’s regional head of retail banking Mr Jaydeep Gupta said the new banking unit was a response to customers’ demands and will improve efficiency and ease of banking.
