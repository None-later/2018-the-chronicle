IMBUBE music lovers in Victoria Falls are poised for a rare treat when Bulawayo’s Indosakusa invades the resort town for a family show next Saturday. The family show which adds to the busy festive music season in the resort town will take place at Chinotimba Community Hall with Victoria Falls’ Umkhankaso Wamajaha being one of the supporting acts. It is expected to kick off at 11AM, a few hours before Victoria Falls carnivalistas go on an evening bush train party. Show coordinator Jacob Sithole who is a member of Umkhankaso Wamajaha said the show was an attempt to ignite life into the genre in the resort town. Imbube groups in Victoria Falls are Ubuntu Bomuntu, Vuka Mthwakazi, Amazulu, Amakhwezi Amnyama and Inguquko White Stars, most who perform at hotels during events for tourists. “We want imbube groups and fans to come together and witness what others do in Bulawayo. I went to Bulawayo and attended their (Indosakusa) show and that’s when I invited them for a show here,” said Sithole. This will be the first imbube event in Victoria Falls since 2004 when Black Umfolosi performed in the town. Victoria Falls Artistes Assembly chairman Ndabezinhle Sibanda said Indosakusa, formerly Impumelelo Shining Stars would surely provide a platform for local fans to interact with the music. He said local groups were stifled by the lack of a platform to market imbube. “The fan base for imbube is small in Victoria Falls as we have never had a proper platform to showcase the genre. We’ve tried before, but the response was low hence we hope the hosting of this show will help. “People understand imbube from their cultural background hence Bulawayo has a better understanding of the genre compared to Victoria Falls where people have an appreciation of traditional dance mostly,” he said. – @ncubeleon
