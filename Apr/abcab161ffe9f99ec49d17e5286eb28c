Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe team for the Confederation of Schools Sport Associations of Southern Africa (Cossasa) championships is camped at Northlea High School in preparation for this year’s athletics event to be held in Francistown, Botswana, next month. Athletes from the National Association of Primary School Heads (Naph) trooped into camp on Tuesday, while their secondary counterparts reported for training on Friday last week, as the defending champions seek to have solid preparations. “We are presently compiling our data to see who has actually come in from the list that we announced at our joint Naph and Nash track and field athletics competition at White City Stadium, but we remain confident of a smooth camping duration,” said Team Zimbabwe manager Phillip Chikomwe. He described camping conditions as conducive and ideal for the athletes. “We are hoping to take 145 athletes to Botswana. We will leave on May 5, rest the following day before competition gets underway from May 7 to 9 and barring any complications, we should be coming back home on May 10,” said Chikomwe. On their way to the winners’ podium last year, Zimbabwe, who were the hosts, hauled 95 medals made up of 40 gold, 26 silver and 29 bronze. Namibia were second with 75 medals and they were followed by Botswana who got 69 medals while Malawi managed only one gold medal to finish in fourth position. Zimbabwe have won the championships four times.
