 Codelia Mondela, Court Reporter A BULAWAYO woman has been arrested for allegedly impersonating a police officer and attempting to arrest an illegal money changer. Lina Ncube (42) informed Ms Memory Nkomo (54) that she wanted to change her money into US$ dollars. She was given $20 in bond notes by Ms Nkomo, but did not give her any United States dollars. After a few minutes, she allegedly declared that she was a police officer hence Ms Nkomo was under arrest for illegally dealing in foreign currency. Ncube pleaded not guilty to charges of impersonation before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Nyarai Ringisai.The magistrate granted her $150 bail and remanded the matter to next Monday for trial. Prosecuting, Mr Kudakwashe Jaravaza alleged that Ncube committed the crime last Thursday at around 2PM.Mr Jaravaza said Ncube approached Ms Nkomo while she was seated along corner Lobengula Street and 6th Avenue and informed her that she was looking for money changers. “Ncube said she wanted to change her $100 bond notes into US dollars. She requested $20 bond notes from Ms Nkomo to use while she waited for her money to be changed. Ncube went to the other side of the road and Ms Nkomo followed her,” he said. “Ncube then stated that she was a Criminal Investigations Department officer (CID) and Ms Nkomo was under arrest for illegally changing money. Ms Nkomo demanded an identity card from her and she failed to produce it.” The court heard that Ncube was arrested and the $20 she took from Ms Nkomo was not recovered.@MondelaC
