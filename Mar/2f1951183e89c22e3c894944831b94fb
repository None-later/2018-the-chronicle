 Sylvester Chiramba, Court Reporter CHIEF Mabhena (53) has been arrested for inciting villagers to illegally occupy a farm in Nyamandlovu resulting in property worth $11 000 being damaged. Chief Mabhena allegedly incited 400 villagers under his jurisdiction to settle at Badminton farm which belongs to Mr Luke Siziba between July 2011 and January 2013. The Chief last Friday appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Lungile Ncube facing incitement to trespass charges. He pleaded not guilty to the charge and was remanded out of custody to March 14 for trial. Prosecuting Mr Claude Fombe said sometime in July 2011, Mr Livingstone Chifamba who is a farm manager at Badminton farm was on patrol when he noticed some people cutting down trees. “Some were erecting shelters and others were clearing land for cultivation. Mr Chifamba then made a report to Mr Siziba,” said Mr Fombe. “Mr Siziba approached the settlers and asked them to vacate his land. The settlers refused arguing that they had the approval of Chief Mabhena. Mr Siziba’s efforts to engage Chief Mabhena were in vain. On February 17 this year Chief Mabhena wrote a letter authorising the settlers to remain on the land.” A report was then made to the police. — @SlyCee10
