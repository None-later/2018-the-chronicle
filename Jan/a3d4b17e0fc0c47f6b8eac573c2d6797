 Grace Nyoni, Business Reporter SHURUGWI Town Council has embarked on a $349 000 street lighting project which will see 100 street lights being installed in the central business district and residential areas. So far, the council has installed 20 solar powered street lights at a cost of $48 000. Shurugwi Town Council chairperson Councillor Tsungai Makore said he was glad to note that they had successfully installed 20 solar powered street lights in the CBD and the road from Unki Mine turn off to Mabhowa bus stop before moving on to the residential areas. Clr Makore said lighting would save residents and visitors from muggings and robberies. “We have installed 20 street lights at a cost of $48 000. “These are part of a massive $349 000 street lighting project that will see us installing 100 street lights in the CBD and residential areas. “Our aim is to install 100 street lights before the end of this month and then extend to other areas before mid-year,” said Clr Makore. He said they engaged the services of Site Specific Safety Plan, a South African Company for the project. Last year, the local authority, through a private public partnership, received $197 000 from Unki Mine which went towards the rehabilitation of Third Street. The local authority also installed the town’s first ever traffic lights at corner Third Street and Chromer Road at a cost of $34 000.
