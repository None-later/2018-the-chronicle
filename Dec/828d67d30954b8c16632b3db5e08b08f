NTABAZINDUNA’s Thokozani ground was a hive of activity when four teams battled it out for honours in the inaugural Ndabendala Football Tournament played on Thursday. The tournament which kicked off in early December with 14 teams from the Ntabazinduna Football Association (NTAFA) was sponsored by local businessman Edwin Mlotshwa. Manchester Legends, whose majority of players are members of the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS), edged Flying Stars FC 3-1 on penalties after the sides had played a one all draw in regulation time. Plans are underway to register amateur side Flying Stars FC into the Bulawayo Division Three League, according to Mlotshwa. “The Flying Stars FC project started as a way of trying to keep local young boys from crime and alcohol abuse and the community appreciates what we are doing for their children. “Now we feel it’s time to take the project a step further by registering the team in Division Three so that these boys can try and make a living through football. The boys need to expose their talents, not only here in Ntabazinduna but other places such as Bulawayo where coaches from bigger clubs can watch them play,” said Mlotshwa. The club has already acquired a mini bus to use for transport when playing away matches in the Bulawayo Division Three League. For winning the tournament, Manchester Legends walked away with a cash prize, a kit and 10 soccer balls. The losing finalists Flying Stars FC took home cash, a kit and five soccer balls.
