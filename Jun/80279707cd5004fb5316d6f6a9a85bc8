Takesure Chiragwi Mukudzei Chingwere, Sports Reporter SHABANIE MINE gaffer Takesure Chiragwi has reportedly left his position at the club in protest over lack of support from the club hierarchy. The club hierarchy last week questioned the tactical wits of the coach after their humiliating 4-0 derby defeat to cross-town rivals FC Platinum. Leading to a hasty decision, which saw the club hiring the quartet of Rowan Nenzou, Gerald Phiri, Elvis Muuya and Alexio Sijioni to bolster the technical department led by Chiragwi. However, Chiragwi who survived the chop with the club last season tendered his resignation late yesterday in protest of the new appointments. Club chairperson Tavaziva Mhloro said he would be able to neither confirm nor deny the resignation after his meeting with the coach late yesterday. “I have heard that he has resigned but I am yet to get any official communication from him, so as it stands they are just rumors. I am meeting him in an hour’s time after that I will be able to say he has resigned or he is still with us for now I cannot say anything,” said Mhloro. The latest confusion in the Shabanie Mine camp is sure to disrupt preparations for their league assignment against Black Rhinos on Sunday. Chiragwi was reportedly working without a contract at the Chinda Boys but the gaffer was using time at the club to market himself as well as players.
