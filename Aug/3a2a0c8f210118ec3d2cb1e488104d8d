Joseph Muchechetere Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter ACTING Sports and Recreation Commission director-general Joseph Muchechetere has emerged as the odds-on favourite to land the substantive post whose interviews were conducted by an independent employment agency last week. Muchechetere has been holding fort since May 2016 when the then incumbent Charles Nhemachena left the post. “The interviews were done last week, albeit for the third time, but this time by an independent employment agency where six prospective candidates were grilled. Indications are that acting DG Muchechetere, who is credited with a number of SRC programmes over the years, is the odds-on favourite to be substantiated, but you never know. A different name might come out depending on how the interviews went,” said a source. Last week, SRC board chairman Edward Siwela confirmed that seven prospective candidates were shortlisted, but one pulled out at the last minute. The successful candidate’s name will be forwarded to the SRC board by the agency, which will deliberate on it before giving the name to the Minister of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation. “In terms of the new Public Entities Act, the minister will also need the approval of the President of the country before announcing the successful candidate,” said the source.
