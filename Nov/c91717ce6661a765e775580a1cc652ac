Sungura maestro, Sulumani Chimbetu and high riding rhumba artiste, Juntal are set for an epic clash in the mining town of Kwekwe at a show slated for Gulez Beer Gardens tomorrow. It will be a rare treat for Kwekwe show lovers as they will get to witness for the first time Juntal in action with his Afromix Band representing rhumba while Captain Sulu will be representing sungura. Sulu, who is likely to be the main act, will be backed by his Orchestra Dendera Kings and will be performing for the first time in the mining town this year. Sulu who was recently appointed Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) ambassador, will be reigniting his chemistry with Kwekwe fans while Juntal of the Mutupo fame, will be performing for the first time in the Midlands town. Juntal (real name Farai Serima), an award-winning artiste who is the undisputed rhumba king in Zimbabwe, is expected to give the Kwekwe music lovers a rare rhumba treat.
