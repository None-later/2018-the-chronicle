 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS men’s basketball team take on National University of Science and Technology (Nust A) in a toast of the Bulawayo Basketball League fixtures at Khanyisile Sports Centre this afternoon. Bosso will be in action for the first time since the leagues’ festive break and will be hoping to add on to their 11 points tally from the eight games played. Nust A have been in action once after the break when they lost 65-48 to title favourites Oilers but that  defeat against high riding Oilers will not deter the students. Bosso coach, Theo Weale is confident of victory in the largely anticipated game in basketball circles. “We are confident going into this game, we lost a number of players during the break but that will not affect us. We have promoted a number of players into the first team who are hungry to play and we hope they will rise to the occasion. “This is going to be a real test, I feel we need to tighten our defence and get the team to defend collectively. Basketball is a team sport, so the boys have to work together if we are to post a positive result. Regardless of the opponents, our camp is confident of victory,” said Weale. In the women’s division Highlanders women have a tricky tie against ruthless Lakers who have spent the better part of the season top of the table. Lakers are undefeated in seven encounters and will be eager to maintain their fine run in the league. Defending champions in the women’s division Southern Mavericks face Divas in what promises to be an exciting duel.
