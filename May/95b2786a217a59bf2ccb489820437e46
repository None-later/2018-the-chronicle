Sam Dzvimbu Sports Reporter THE Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) is working on a framework that will require administrators to be holders of the commission’s certificates to lead any sport organisation. SRC Bulawayo provincial coordinator Sam Dzvimbu said they had started the process of capacitating administrators and will hold a Level One Sports Administration course at Eveline High School in Bulawayo from May 26-27. “Very soon the SRC will make it a prerequisite for any aspiring sports administrator to hold a basic certificate from the commission to be able to lead any sporting board or club. “We know that sporting bodies do have their own courses, but it is equally important that those aspiring to be in administrative positions are trained by the SRC to ensure smooth governance,” said Dzvimbu. The course the SRC will hold in Bulawayo will cover changing trends that affect the sporting industry; the history of Zimbabwe’s sport from the colonial era to post independence, developments that led to the establishment of the SRC, how to run a sports club and long term athletes’ development. Participants are expected to understand how to identify and nurture talent, sports management, marketing, doping and safe sport, communication, risk management and understanding the SRC and its structures. Deputy director in the Ministry of Sport, Arts and Recreation, Isaiah Mpofu, Bhekuzulu Khumalo from Nust’s Sports Science department and Dzvimbu will be the course facilitators. Registration for the course is $30 and the SRC is looking at about 100 participants.
