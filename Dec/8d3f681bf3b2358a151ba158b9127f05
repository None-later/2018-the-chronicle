The Chronicle Simon Khaya Moyo
WE have been hit by a storm. Our hearts are lacerated and bleeding. We are still in shock and the nation is in bewilderment. Lidume ledlula. I say this because Professor Phinias Makhurane, the illustrious founding Vice Chancellor of the National University of Science and Technology (Nust) is no more. His footprints grace many other centres of higher learning the world over. His departure is a massive blow not only to his family but to the entire nation of Zimbabwe. He was a solid personality. An accomplished academic giant. A man of purpose. A total human being. A man of impressive intellectual skills. A man of unassuming standing and enviable humility. Those who knew him well can testify that his contribution to this nation was not only immense but immeasurable.
A distinguished scholar of international repute. Although he hailed from Matabeleland South Province and this region he belonged to Zimbabwe. His attributes remain a lasting legacy for generations to come. He was indeed a jewel to humanity. He has departed for higher responsibility. He will return. He was indeed a man of purpose, principled and of admirable perseverance. A “double brain” as he was known in many informed circles. A perfect genius. The nation is indeed poorer by his absence. Go well son of the soil. May his dear soul anchor and rest in eternal peace. It is in this vein that the late Professor Makhurane has been declared a National Hero. – Ambassador Simon Khaya Moyo is the Zanu-PF Secretary for Information and Publicity and Senator for Matabeleland South
