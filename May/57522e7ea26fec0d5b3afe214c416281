Elvis Chipezeze Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter CHICKEN Inn have been dealt a body blow ahead of their away encounter against Chapungu United as they will be without influential goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze and striker Obriel Chirinda due to suspension. The duo have accumulated three yellow cards and will be joined by Highlanders’ holding midfielder Adrian Silla. “The players listed below have accumulated 3 yellow cards and shall not participate in their club’s matchday eleven of the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League scheduled for 12 and 13 May 2018,” said the PSL in a statement. Chirinda received his first yellow card on March 29 when the Gamecocks played against league debutants Mutare City Rovers and picked up a second in the Bulawayo derby against Highlanders and was again on the receiving end when they played Bulawayo City last week. Chipezeze, the reigning Castle Lager Goalkeeper of the Year, was yellow carded in all the two derbies against Highlanders and Bulawayo City as well as on their 1-0 away win over Caps United. In the absence of Chipezeze, Chicken Inn coach Joe Antipas will throw in Pride Zendera. For Highlanders’ Silla, he picked up his first yellow card when Bosso shook off the challenge of Herentals in Harare as well as the Barbourfields duels against Chicken Inn and ZPC Kariba, which they both failed to collect maximum points from after drawing 2-2 against the GameCocks going down 1-2 loss to the electricity men last Sunday.
