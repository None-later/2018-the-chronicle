Thandeka Moyo, Health Reporter A TOTAL of 147 primary and secondary school pupils dropped out of school in Bulawayo during the first quarter of this year due to pregnancy, marriage and financial constraints amid reports that sexually transmitted infections continue to rise in the city. According to provincial first quarter statistics from the National Aids Council (Nac) most of the children dropped out of school due to financial challenges and the worst affected are primary school pupils. “The province recorded a substantial number of school dropouts in the quarter under review. A total of 147 children dropped out of school due to financial reasons. Of those pupils 23 girls dropped out of school due to pregnancy and marriage,” reads the report. From the 23 girls who fell pregnant, one was recorded at a primary school. “Seven girls were forced out of secondary school due to marriage and only one pupil dropped out of school due to illness,” it says. According to the same report, the cases of STIs rose from 2 163 to 2 214 during the quarter under review. “The new STI cases in the province are concentrated in the 20 to 49 years age group. Young women in the age group 15 to 19 reported three times more new STI cases than the young men in the same age group, confirming intergenerational sexual relationships,” reads the report. Nac Bulawayo provincial monitoring and evaluation officer Mr Douglas Moyo recently said inconsistent use of condoms and low risk perception were the major causes of the high number of new STIs. “We recorded 1 396 new STI infections for women and 1 098 for men during the first quarter last year during the same period. We have global targets that we are aiming at as a country and so far we have done well in ensuring people get tested,” said Mr Moyo. He added that many people take HIV and Aids lightly because they say they know everything regarding the pandemic. @thamamoe
