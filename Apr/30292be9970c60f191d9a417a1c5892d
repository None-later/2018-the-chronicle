 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter UNBEATEN Premiership debutants Bulawayo Chiefs have expressed satisfaction with the way they have adapted to life in the top-flight league. The new boys have displayed exciting football to date that has seen them go for four games without a defeat and that show has charmed a number of neutrals as evidenced by the reasonable crowds at their home matches. Fitness trainer, Thulani Sibanda, who took the team to the top league as head coach but has handed the baton to Garthly Chipuka for lack of a Caf “A” badge as required by Zifa, said they were happy with the way the team had progressed. “I think we are improving with each game, I believe the team is progressing well. Being unbeaten is now a culture in the team. Most of the boys who are playing in the team last lost a game in 2016, of course we lost a game against Chiwororo last term but that was a week after we had gained promotion and played a reserve side that went on to lose that game. It is not something strange for the boys to go for games unbeaten. It is a process that we have gone through before,” said Sibanda. On keeping most of the squad from the Division One side Sibanda said: “Your ability to play in the topflight league is judged by the ability to qualify to play in the league, so l do not see why there is need to discard players who won us promotion. We have seen teams buy players and still get relegated. There is no substitute for talent, if a player is talented they should be given a chance to play regardless they are from a lower division.”
