She was convicted on her own plea and ordered to pay a fine of $100 or spend 90 days in jail. Mr Shoko said on Wednesday last week Mrs Dliwayo was alerted by Mrs Ndlovu who had seen some of her child’s clothes at Mulawuzi’s house. “Mrs Dliwayo went to the accused person’s house and recovered the clothes,” said Mr Shoko The court heard that Mrs Dliwayo and Mrs Ndlovu then filed a report at Cowdray Park Police Station leading to the arrest of the two women who are married to one man. @SlyCee10
