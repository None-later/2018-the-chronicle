 Sylvester Chiramba, Court Reporter A BULAWAYO woman had property worth $29 000 stolen from her car while she was being cleansed by spiritual healers at Khami Dam on the outskirts of the city. Kenneth Bune (33), of no fixed abode, allegedly smashed a window to Nokuthula Dube’s car which had been left unattended and stole 400 grammes of gold, a gold detector, cell phones and identification documents. He appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Ms Tancy Dube yesterday facing one count of theft from a car. Bune pleaded not guilty to the charge and was remanded in custody to February 13 for trial. Prosecuting, Mr Chief Muteve said on December 12 last year at around 9AM, Dube parked her car and locked it in the bushes near Khami Dam. “She proceeded to the dam in the company of spiritual healers for cleansing in the dam. During her absence, Bune approached the car and smashed a window to gain access,” said Mr Muteve. “He stole property which included 400g of gold, a gold detector, four Samsung cell phones, identification documents and some clothes and went away. “Investigations were carried out and with the help of service providers, one of the stolen phones was tracked and found in the possession of Godfrey Govere from Makokoba.” Govere, said Mr Muteve, indicated that he had bought the cell phone from Bune and a manhunt was carried out in Mzilikazi where Bune was thought to be residing but he was not found.” The court heard that Bune was finally located and arrested in Old Pumula on January 11 following a tip off. Only a cell phone worth $800 was recovered. — @SlyCee10.
