Sam Dzvimbu Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) Bulawayo province is due to convene a sports medicine course to equip the sports practitioners with the latest trends in sports injury prevention, care and management. SRC Bulawayo provincial coordinator Sam Dzvimbu said the course would be held at the United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH), Richard Morris Nurses’ Home from June 30 to July 1. “Sport is now highly scientific and we have noted that we need to move with the latest trends in sports medicine and our hope is that this will help our coaches assist athletes to prevent potential injuries. “In the event that they occur, they should know how to care for them. “It is also our conviction that if we are to maximise on the potential of athletes, we need to infuse science into training and competition, and sports medicine becomes a key component of our sport programmes,” said Dzvimbu. “The course will also cover topics such as how to detect and assess injuries as well as prevention and referral system. We also want to expose the officials to playing environment and practical sessions, as sometimes injuries occur as a result of the playing surfaces or environments which expose athletes to high risks of injury. Practical sessions are also integral in giving a better insight into the gist of what sports medicine is all about”, he said. This course is part of an educational drive the SRC has embarked on as it implements its 2018 action plan. Some of the courses that will be offered during the course of the year include sports administration, event management and community sport leader course. Registration is $60 per person.
