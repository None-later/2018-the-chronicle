ZIMDANCEHALL chanter Tocky Vibes proved quite unpopular in Bulawayo as he failed to pull crowds at The Vista on Thursday. Maybe the low turnout was due to the fact that his show with Mzoe 7 clashed with the hosting of the Kalawa Homecoming Club Version Party at Club Cosmopolitan which had a South African line-up of Busiswa, DJ Zinhle and Bobsta, likely making it a better deal. Even though the Homecoming party show was being charged in foreign currency, many still thronged the venue. Tocky Vibes has been having a rocky career as he is failing to reclaim his glory of the Mhai days. The artiste released an album last month that does not seem to be popular. This is making it difficult for the artiste to attract huge crowds compared to artistes like Winky D, Killer T and Seh Calaz. Tocky who took to the stage at around 1AM just after Mzoe 7’s energetic performance, did not perform well as he sounded off tune. It was as if he was not enjoying performing his own songs as his stage presence was not impressive. The chanter sang some of his classic songs like Aenda Nenyika, Mhai and Kufamba Toti Toti. A day before his Bulawayo performance, Tocky had performed in Beitbridge at Pagomba Café where he also had another poor performance. Tocky Vibes might need to go back to the drawing board to perfect his craft if he is to attract huge crowds in future.
