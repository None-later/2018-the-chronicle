Tendai Ndoro TENDAI Ndoro’s former club is currently in a legal fight for its future at present, but the player himself will be more interested in where he will be playing his football next season. As reported, Mamelodi Sundowns and newly-promoted Highlands Park are believed to have joined the likes of Kaizer Chiefs, Bidvest Wits and SuperSport United as potential suitors for the Zimbabwean attacker as he considers his next move. The situation regarding the 30-year-old striker’s eligibility is something that has been all over the news in South Africa as Ajax Cape Town were relegated and then reinstated for playing Ndoro, reportedly against the advice of the league, with the forward having played for three clubs over the course of last season. All five clubs are thought to be considering making a move for Ndoro now that he’s a free agent, with the forward recently being given his clearance by the Urban Warriors despite their ongoing battle. Given the fact that he has no contract, the former Orlando Pirates man is not bound by next month’s transfer window deadline, however, he will be keen to get his future finalised as soon as possible. – Soccer Laduma
