 Masvingo Correspondent Over 1 000 farmers in drought-prone Mwenezi have received training in small grains production as part of efforts to boost food security in the district. The training, which was conducted by the Zimbabwe Farmers Union, came in the wake of recurrent droughts. ZFU Masvingo regional manager, Mr Jeremiah Chimwanda, said at least 100 farmers from each of the 10 wards were trained. “We realised that Mwenezi was lagging behind in terms of crop production because of perennial dry spells, he said. ZFU then resolved to engage farming experts to train communal farmers in the district on the production of drought-tolerant small grains such as rapoko, sorghum and millet.’’ Mr Chimwanda said his organisation planned to replicate the small grains production training programme in other remaining districts in the province to improve food security at household level. The farmers were drawn from Mukumi, Maranda and Neshuro communal areas. ZFU has helped communal farmers in Mwenezi to set up groups to enable them to transport their farming produce to the market without challenges. Mr Chimwanda said besides the sale of agricultural produce following last year’s bumper harvest throughout Mwenezi, cattle farmers had also been assisted to set up groups for easy movement of their cattle to abattoirs across the province.
