Vimbai Moyo and Tsitsi Mahere won silver in the doubles category. Zimbabwe team coach Farai Tapfuma was elated with the individual and overall team performances. “I would like to thank all parents for the support they gave the team. They gave their best and we were runners-up in the Under-14 category, which is impressive. Our performance was fairly good,” said Tapfuma. “Our Under-16 players need to play more Under-18 International Tennis Federation (ITF) tournaments and Under-14s should take part in more Central Africa Tennis (CAT) meets to get more international exposure,” he said. The Under-16 team comprised Mugarira, Vimbai Moyo and Tsitsi Mahere in the girls’ category, while Tinashe Taruberekera, Taona Muhwandagara and Zamani Moyo were in the boys team.
