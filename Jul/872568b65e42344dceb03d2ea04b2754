Dr Joram Gumbo Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent GOVERNMENT yesterday warned motorists driving vehicles for political parties on the campaign trail to desist from drunken driving, overloading and speeding as this has become rampant ahead of the harmonised polls. In an interview, Transport and Infrastructure Development Minister Dr Joram Gumbo said he has noted with concern, reckless driving by members of political parties canvassing for votes. “As they move with the campaigns they drink a lot. So I urge political parties to restrain and control their members so that they should take care on the roads. I urge our drivers to be very careful on the roads. We want them to be alive. We want them to cast their votes,” said Dr Gumbo. National police spokesperson Chief Superintendent Paul Nyathi said it was everyone’s responsibility to prevent accidents on the roads. He said police will impartially arrest members of any political party who will be found guilty of reckless driving. Chief Supt Nyathi encouraged politicians to hold their rallies in time to reduce chances of travelling at night. “All in all we are saying everyone should contribute towards safety on the roads. Our police officers will actually take action where an accident occurs where people were either travelling at night or were using defective vehicles,” he said. Chief Supt Nyathi warned motorists against overloading. He also said they must comply with the law and cooperate with police officers deployed across the country. Last month, 19 MDC Alliance supporters were seriously injured after a truck they were travelling in overturned in Binga as they were coming from a rally addressed by their leader, Advocate Nelson Chamisa at Manjolo Business Centre in Binga.—@nqotshili
