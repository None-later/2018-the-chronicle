Ramsey K and Khuliyo’s collaborative Ngqobe album launch at the Bulawayo Theatre last Saturday was exhilarating, entertaining and above all, showed that Ramsey K is quite a performer. For a long time, Ramsey K had been touted as the king of covers in the city as no one did it better than him. While they appreciated his talent, most of his followers felt he needed to get out of this comfort zone and compose his own songs. He has taken heed of his fans’ calls and recorded a 10-track afro-jazz album with Khuliyo. Although the launch began late, it was worth the wait as the two musicians delivered on stage. They had the crowd’s attention all throughout the show. Ramsey K’s powerful soprano was complemented by Khuliyo’s baritone. Songs such as Mama, Eshabhini and Ngiyephi were the stand out tracks during the event. Khuliyo who released his debut album that was fairly received last year, also showed that he has grown as an artiste. It was a night of surprises as Thandi Dlana made a return to the stage as a supporting act. Her rendition of Simphiwe Dana’s Ndiredi was emotional and earned her a standing ovation. There was no way Ramsey K was going to end a performance without performing some covers. It was at this stage that the show went into overdrive. He started off with Bekezela’s self-titled track Bekezela and also performed renditions of Lovemore Majaivana. As the crowd cheered, sang and danced along, Ramsey K led them like a choir master. When the show ended, people clearly did not want to leave the venue as they were now in a party mood.
