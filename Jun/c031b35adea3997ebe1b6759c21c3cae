Peter de Villiers CAPE TOWN — Zimbabwe, under the guidance of former Springbok coach Peter de Villiers, are preparing to continue their 2019 Rugby World Cup qualifying campaign. The Rugby Africa Gold Cup will take place in two weekends’ time where six teams will take part in 15 matches. Whoever finishes top of that log will advance to next year’s showpiece in Japan, while the second-placed side will advance to a repechage round with three other international teams in another round robin format where one side will secure the last World Cup qualification slot. Zimbabwe begin their Gold Cup campaign by hosting Morocco on June 16, and De Villiers is happy with the preparation of the squad following a recently-completed training camp in Pretoria. “85% of our players play in Zimbabwe and we have worked a lot on self-confidence,” De Villiers said. The tournament ends on August 18. Kenya, Namibia, Tunisia and Uganda are the other competing nations. Zimbabwe last appeared at a Rugby World Cup in England. — Sport24
