He threatened her with death again. “There were no dates for the other occasions but on June 8, the victim fell sick and was rushed to a local clinic where it was discovered that she was six months pregnant,” said the source. The source said the woman revealed the matter and when the suspect heard that he was wanted, he disappeared. @winnie_masara
