Cde Supa Mandiwanzira Harare Bureau Zanu-PF’s aspiring MP for Nyanga South Cde Supa Mandiwanzira said President Mnangagwa is expected to win yesterday’s polls in the constituency. Speaking after casting his vote at Manjoro Primary School, Cde Mandiwanzira said he was confident the revolutionary party will sail through. “I think there is no doubt about who will win in Nyanga South. There is no question about this one. It is President Mnangagwa, it is Supa Mandiwanzira and all Zanu-PF councillors. It is not just winning, but winning resoundingly,” he said. Cde Mandiwanzira said people in the constituency were looking forward for real change. “The support people have for Zanu-PF here cannot be doubted. They are excited and looking forward to real change that has been brought about by President Mnangagwa. They want to cement his leadership by giving him a totally fresh mandate; that is, his own mandate. They are very excited because President Mnangagwa has fresh ideas. He is associating himself with new thinking and not the old thinking,” he said. Cde Mandiwanzira is contesting against Webster Ngonzwe (MDC-T) Talent Kadzima (independent) Nickson Mupotsa (#FMZ) Sanyanga Tonderai (MDC-Alliance). Zanu-PF candidate for Nyanga North Cde Chido Sanyatwe indicated that people were voting peacefully. “I am the first woman to contest for Nyanga North since 1980. I am going to win resoundingly. People came out in their numbers and all has been going on well,” she said. “My election into this position would solve the gender imbalance in Parliament. I am one of the few women who are contesting for a Parliamentary seat in the country. I am confident that I am going to win resoundingly. President Mnangagwa will also win resoundingly.”
