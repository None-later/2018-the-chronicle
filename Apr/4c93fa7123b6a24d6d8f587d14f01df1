Polite Ncube Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter POLICE are appealing to relatives of a suspected sex worker who died on Monday at her client’s house in Bulawayo’s Barbourfields suburb to come forward and claim her body. Bulawayo Metropolitan police spokesperson Inspector Precious Simango said the body of the woman who was only identified as Hazel Sibanda (27) still remained unclaimed at Mpilo Central Hospital Mortuary. “We appeal to members of the public to come forward and claim the body of a woman who was only identified by her client as Hazel Sibanda (27). The woman had no identity particulars on her. “She allegedly suddenly died on Monday at around 11AM at Polite Ncube’s house at 4039 Mbuyazwe, Barbourfields suburb. “If anyone has more information on this woman, may they contact their nearest police station,” she said. According to Ncube, Sibanda died after she had allegedly complained of not feeling well earlier that morning. He summoned an ambulance but the ambulance crew pronounced her dead on arrival at the scene. Ncube told The Chronicle news crew that he was Sibanda’s regular client. He said he usually picked her up along 13th Avenue where she paraded among other sex workers. He said he did not know any of Sibanda’s relatives or where she lived in Bulawayo, saying she had once mentioned that her rural home was in Mbembesi. Sibanda, Ncube said, had informed him that she was HIV positive but had since defaulted on her anti-retroviral treatment. Residents at Mbuyazwe Flats said they had seen Sibanda leaving the house on several instances and could see she was not well as she struggled to walk to the road to catch a commuter omnibus.—@winnie_masara
