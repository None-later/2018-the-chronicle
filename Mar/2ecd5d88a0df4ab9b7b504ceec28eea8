Donald Ndebele Sports Reporter BULAWAYO Amateur Boxing Association (Baba) and Sizinda South Beer Garden have entered into a partnership that will see the former staging tournaments at the venue for free at least twice a month. Stephen Masiyambumbi, a Baba executive committee member, said through the partnership, local boxers will get an opportunity to have regular fights and improve their skills. “We’re grateful to Sizinda South Beer Garden who have agreed to house us and use the facility as a permanent home for Baba. After realising that boxers train almost every day and only get to fight maybe once a month or once in two months, we thought that the best way to improve the sport is try and have boxers fighting regularly. We had to identify a venue and we are happy that Sizinda South Beer Garden have agreed to partner us,” said Masiyambumbi. Baba have held a number of tournaments at the venue since last year and Sizinda South Beer Garden also played host to a national tournament. Donald Ndebele, who operates Sizinda South Beer Garden said through the partnership they will be able to provide quality entertainment to the locals. “Traditionally boxing is popular at old locations and we are honoured that Baba decided to set up a permanent base here. We have had good crowds whenever there are boxing tournaments and hopefully we will continue to have people coming to support boxing. “Another thing that made us agree to the deal is that we are trying to do away with the notion that a beer garden is only a place for beer and partying. Boxing can even inspire youth from the surrounding community to take it up as sport,” Ndebele said. Besides playing host to boxing tournaments and musical shows, Sizinda South Beer Garden once held the biggest darts tournament in Bulawayo where they gave away a cow to the winning teams.
