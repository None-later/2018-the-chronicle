Nkosilodumo Ndebele, Showbiz Reporter ALLIANCE Francoise De Bulawayo — a language and culture centre based in Bulawayo will today host a graduation ceremony for students who excelled in the 2017 French exams. The students will receive internationally recognised French certificates awarded by the Ministry of Education in France. Ninety six students passed. “We are awarding our students because they worked very hard. We were mainly examining their competence in the four micro skills of language which include; listening, speaking, reading and writing,” said the ceremony organiser Mthulisi Ncube. The students have been presented with an opportunity to be au pairs. These are people who relocate and live with a family in France and assist in various household chores while others will be qualified to be French teachers. This will be the second time the centre hosts the awards of that nature, having last hosted them in 2004. “Although we have not been doing the graduation ceremony more often in the past, we have realised that it is a key event and we must have more in the future because it encourages our students to work even harder,” said Ncube. The Language and Culture centre offers Ndebele, Shona and Sesotho locally while for foreign languages it offers Spanish, Portuguese and Japanese. Since Alliance Francaise is a language and cultural centre, they also help locals showcase talent through theatre, music and book launches. “So far, we have helped promote a number of artistes in the arts, which include Impumelelo Shining Stars, Early Entertainment and Simon Mambazo Phiri amongst others,” said Mthulisi Ncube. The artistes are showcased in functions like the Zim Hip Hop awards, World Music Day and the Intwasa Festival.
