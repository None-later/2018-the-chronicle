 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE inaugural edition of the Gweru Half Marathon and cycle is set to headline Africa Day celebrations in the Midlands province on Friday. The community event is being organised by Native Collective. “We are going to use this event to celebrate ourselves as Africans. This is a community-based initiative where we are saying to the community keep moving and keep fit. This is going to be our first event and we are hoping to grow this meet into a bigger event in the coming years. It is going to be a fun-filled day and we expect to have an exciting competition. All interested people should come and be part of this event,” said events coordinator Tipei Lorata Dube. The event will have four categories, including a cycling event, with the finishing point for all events being the Midlands Christian College. “Registration is $10 for the 21km race, $5 for the 10km, $3 for the 5km and $15 for the 42km cycling event. The start off point for the 21km race will be the Midlands State University main campus, while the 10km race will start at Simpson Road, Kopje. The 5km race will begin at Lobengula Road, Kopje, and the 42km cycling race starts at Dabuka,” said Dube. The winner for the 21km race will walk away $1 000 richer, with the top 10 athletes in that event getting prizes. In the 10km race, the winner will receive $500, while vouchers are in store for winners of the 5km race.
