 Michelle Gwizi, Chronicle Reporter THREE MEN from Bulawayo have been arrested for a series of robberies they allegedly committed in the city while driving a stolen car. Talent Tshange (22), Wayne Sinyalo (24) and Bernard Mpofu (25) allegedly hired a taxi driver Noel Matsvayire (30) at night on July 10 to take them to Mzilikazi suburb. Bulawayo magistrate Ms Sibonginkosi Mnkandla remanded the accused persons in custody to August 17 for trial after they pleaded not guilty to robbery charges. Prosecuting, Mr Dumisani Ndlovu said on July 10 at around 2:30AM, Mr Matsvayire was hired by the accused persons from Pub Lagondola Night Club situated between 10th and 11th Avenue along Robert Mugabe Street to Thokozani Flats in Mzilikazi. The taxi driver was driving his Toyota Raum vehicle. “Upon arrival at Thokozani Flats Sinyalo instructed him to stop the car and immediately grabbed Matsvayire twisting his neck demanding cash and valuables while threatening to stab him if he did not comply. The three accused then kicked Mr Matsvayire out of his car and drove off,” he said. The three also stole $60 cash and a Nokia cell phone from Mr Matsvayire who later reported the matter to the police. Mr Ndlovu said later on the same day, while armed with knives the accused persons stole Mr Siphiwe Tshabangu’s Samsung phone, jacket, CBZ card and licence while driving Mr Matsvayire’s car. Again on the same day they allegedly robbed Mr Achem Mpala of his Alcatel phone, a handbag containing a blue work suit and $15 while driving the stolen car. The motor vehicle was recovered dumped in Bulawayo. The total value of stolen property including the car was $3 785 and property worth nearly $240 was not recovered. @gwizi_n
