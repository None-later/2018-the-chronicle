Babongile Sikhonjwa Showbiz Correspondent THE Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards (RoilBAA) nominees have been released with some surprises and shocking nominations. Hosted by the global citizen Gilmore Tee and model and personality Princess Mpofu, the reveal party held at the Bulawayo Theatre on Friday saw Babongile Sikhonjwa being nominated in the male artiste of the year category, shocking many. Most are questioning which art form, Sikhonjwa, a radio personality who last year was more involved in the broadcast sphere than in stand-up comedy, was nominated for. Sikhonjwa was equally bewildered and confused as to how he fitted into the category judging by the look on his face when his name was announced. Another award, the Male Model of the year had chatter on social media as some people like award-winning photographer Mgcini Nyoni were not happy with the nominees – Welsh the Stylist and Panashe Beaton – saying they are not established models, save for Shadel Noble. A surprise was the inclusion of Jaiva Sibone, a local movie that premiered on Zambezi Magic on April 25 when the closing dates for nominations was April 13. Also, Dlala Ngamla – a series about ghetto life premiered on April 22 leaving one wondering how the movie was nominated when it premiered a week after the nominations deadline. The outstanding playwright and the Primary Schools outstanding schools effort awards, which had a few nominations, have been excluded from this year’s awards that will be held on May 26 at the Bulawayo Large City Hall. The Outstanding Visual Artist two and three dimensional have been combined into a single award after receiving few nominations. However, hip hop gospel artiste T1nda is leading the pack with three nominations in Outstanding Gospel Act, Hip Hop artist and video.
