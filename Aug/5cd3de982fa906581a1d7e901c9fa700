 Thandeka Moyo, Chronicle Reporter INCOMING Zanu-PF Nkayi South Member of Parliament Cde Stars Mathe has enunciated her vision for development of the constituency following her victory in the 2018 harmonised elections. In an interview yesterday, Cde Mathe said her plan hinged on fixing the road network  in the area, which is among the worst in the country. She said she was humbled that people had chosen her to serve them. “I am optimistic that our roads can be fixed as Government recently announced that funds were set aside for roads. The poor road network is the major reason why Nkayi remains underdeveloped, years after Independence,” said Cde Mathe. “I will do my best to ensure the people of Nkayi witness development in their communities. Firstly, I will ensure Nkayi is on the map as our community is characterised by a lot of underdevelopment”. Cde Mathe, a 56-year-old mother of four, said as a former teacher who taught for 12 years, she was concerned about the poor O-Level pass rate in the district. “Our pupils learn from poor facilities and they walk long distances to school. It affects their performance. Nkayi is also a dry                                                   area and I would be lying if I say my people are not prone to starvation and water challenges,” she said. “Our O-Level pass rate is very poor compared to other areas and very few of our children make it to A-Level. I plan to engage families, children and everyone to work harder because I know they perform dismally as they have low morale due to social issues”. Cde Mathe said the availability of adequate food in households is the first indicator of development. “We also have serious water problems and our people are in need of irrigation projects and boreholes. I will have to work hard on this one as we have suffered,” she said. Cde Mathe was once a councillor for Ward 28 in Cowdray Park, Bulawayo. —@thamamoe
