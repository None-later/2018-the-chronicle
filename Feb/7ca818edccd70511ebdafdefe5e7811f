 Tadious Manyepo, Harare Bureau AMBITIOUS Zimbabwe professional wrestler Jonathan Muvingi has set his sights on competing in the World Wrestling Entertainment arena after posting some fine performances in the last few years. The 28-year-old Black Rhinos fighter only turned professional in 2016 and has since posted a clean 15-0 record. Muvingi, who grabbed national headlines in recent weeks after he appeared on state television pulling a haulage truck, last weekend underlined his growing status as the best open-weight wrestler in the country after knocking out Adam Tagwirei in the eighth round during the season opening tournament in Harare. “I am working hard to try and better myself in terms of strength, skill and balance. “So far so good. Since I turned professional almost two years ago, I have gone to South Africa, Malawi among other countries where I have come out victorious. “I have failed to go to other bigger tournaments in other countries due to financial challenges. My aim is to fight in the World Wrestling Entertainment where I think I will raise my country’s flag high. “What I know is that I am very fit and age is still on my side but one thing which has stood in my way is lack of sponsorship. “With some corporate backing, I am very confident that I will become one of the best professional wrestlers to emerge from this country,” he said. In the weekend tournament, Josam Chirumuuta defeated Paddington Mashaire in the light weight category while Edward Dembedza got the better of Tapiwa Mukoni in the 75-80kg section.
