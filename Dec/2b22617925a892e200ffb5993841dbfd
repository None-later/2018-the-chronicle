A 27-YEAR-OLD deaf and dumb man who allegedly raped a 34-year-old woman after finding her urinating behind a bar, has appeared in court. Willard Mguni from Gobalitombo, Bazha, Matobo in Matabeleland South pleaded not guilty to a rape charge before Bulawayo magistrate, Mrs Sibongile Marondedze. Ms Marondedze remanded him in custody to Tuesday for continuation of trial. Mguni’s trial was delayed because the State had to engage a special interpreter because Mguni does not understand sign language. There was a chart in the courtroom with diagrams illustrating what allegedly transpired when Mguni is said to have attacked the woman. Prosecuting, Ms Concilia Ncube said the complainant went to Zamangothando Bar at Bazha Business Centre looking for her boyfriend. “She went behind a bar and partially undressed to relieve herself. Mguni, who happened to be having his drinks there as well, followed her and grabbed her,” said Ms Ncube. “Mguni twisted her arm and dragged her to a spot about five metres away from the toilet. The complainant screamed but no one came to her rescue. Mguni pushed her to the ground and raped her once,” she said. In his defence, Mguni said he had consensual sex with the complainant. “We agreed on what we were doing, I paid her $6 and even asked her to come to my home and wash my clothes some day. I was surprised when the police arrested me, all that she told you are lies I did not rape her,” said Mguni. The court heard that after the incident, Mguni went to another bar and the complainant went to report the matter to the police leading to his arrest. — @gwizi_n
