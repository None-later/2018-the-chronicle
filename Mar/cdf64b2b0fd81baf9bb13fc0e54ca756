 Takudzwa Chitsiga, Harare Bureau ZIMBABWE Rugby Sevens assistant coach, Tangai Nemadire, believes the Kwesé Sports Victoria Falls Sevens tournament is good for their preparations for this year’s Rugby World Cup Sevens. Nemadire and the team had second day session at Innovate Gym said they look forward to reclaiming the title they won last year. The Zimbabwe Cheetahs will have three teams in the tournament at Victoria Falls Primary School on Saturday and Sunday and it has come just before the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series qualifying tournament in Hong Kong from April 6–8. The Cheetahs are expected to leave for Victoria Falls on Friday and will play teams from Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Swaziland, Botswana, Morocco and Senegal. Nemadire said they were copying very well and welcomed some new faces whom he thinks will add value to the team. “The tournament comes at the right time considering that we are a few weeks away from the Hong Kong game. The guys are faring well and I can safely say in terms of fitness we are 90 percent ready. “It is good that we will now have three teams at the tournament and that will give us a clear picture of players at our disposal.“The guys have turned out in their numbers although we are expecting the foreign-based contingent before the game,” said Nemadire. Initially, Zimbabwe was expected to take their preparations to South Africa with head coach, Gilbert Nyamutsamba assembling a strong 30-member team back in January.
