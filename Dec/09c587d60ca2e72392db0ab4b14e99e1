POLICE have arrested a suspect who allegedly attacked a 77-year-old man in Filabusi last month, resulting in his death while admitted to the United Bulawayo Hospitals on Sunday. Mr Steven Dlamini of Pilot 30 Village, Pioneer area was attacked on the night of November 6 by two men for reasons that could not be established immediately. One suspect has been arrested while his alleged accomplice is on the run. Prince Ndebele (22) and Mihla Ndlovu allegedly burst into the kitchen hut in which the old man was sleeping and bashed him with logs until he passed out. The two fled into the darkness. Dlamini was ferried to Filabusi District Hospital and was transferred to the United Bulawayo Hospitals where he was admitted until the time of his death. Police have since arrested Ndebele and a man hunt for his alleged accomplice Ndlovu is underway. Matabeleland South police spokesperson Chief Inspector Philisani Ndebele yesterday confirmed the arrest of one suspect. “I can confirm we are investigating a case of murder of a 77-year-old man that occurred in Filabusi. The old man was assaulted a month ago and the case which was initially reported as attempted murder, is now being treated as murder, following the death of the old man on Sunday. “We are appealing to members of the public who may know the whereabouts of the other suspect, Mihla, to come forward. Reasons for the attack are not yet known,” he said. —@winnie_masara
