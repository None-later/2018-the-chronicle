Skolopad IN a dramatic moment just before Shekhinah took to the stage at the South African Music Awards (Samas), Skolopad, dressed in a black sheer number, had to be stretchered out by paramedics after she collapsed. Paramedics said she was fine and suffering from exhaustion. “She fainted, she is OK. It was just some weird exhaustion. But she is awake and still on my stretcher,” a paramedic said before rushing back to her. She was later taken to hospital although a source close to Sunday World revealed that she insisted she was fine and just wanted to be taken back to her hotel room to rest. When Skolopad arrived at the event, the red carpet was already closed. Last year, she made headlines for her boerewors ensemble. President Cyril Ramaphosa also attended the 24th Samas at Sun City – which meant stricter security. This was much to the annoyance of A-listers who got stuck in a long queue resulting in them missing the first 30 minutes of the show. There was more drama on the red carpet as rapper Riky Rick made his way in. He was hardly recognisable in his avant-garde balaclava-inspired headpiece. Then there was praise poet Jessica Mbangeni in her larger-than-life peacock ball gown. Stars such as Nandi Madida and Nomuzi Mabena went for a 1920s retro look that was very Great Gatsby. Boity Thulo, Khanya Mkangisa and Nina Hastie turned up the heat in daring sexy looks. But Thulo’s dress was seen last week on the Miss SA contestants. Emtee, Keabetswe Motsilanyane (KB) and Arthur Mafokate made it a family affair by bringing their kids along. Shekhinah caused quite a stir by winning big in the top five categories. Her debut album, Rose Gold, won her album of the year, female artiste of the year and newcomer of the year. – SundayWorld
