Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Under-21 handball team held a four-day periodic camp in Kadoma from last Wednesday in preparation for the Zone Six Youth Challenge Trophy to be held in Zambia in April. Twenty-seven players drawn from all the 10 provinces attended the camp at Jameson High School. The country is required to travel with 14 boys and girls to the tournament. Countries expected to take part in the tournament include South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe will be hoping to improve on their bronze medal finish in the tournament’s last edition in 2017. National Under-21 coach Cephas Mushati is confident of building a formidable side for the Zone Six games. “We figured that the Zimbabwe national handball teams do not usually perform well in competitions because we do not give ourselves enough time to prepare. We are confident of doing well this year. Our biggest challenge however is that last year we had problems in running our league. “The league is supposed to provide more game time to our players to enable them to compete in big tournaments like the Zone Six,” said Mushati. He said the Bulawayo Handball Association is working towards reviving its league.
