 Thandiwe Katinhimure, Business Reporter THE Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) has secured a licence to construct and operate a 100 megawatt solar photovoltaic plant in Gwanda. The Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority yesterday said it had granted ZPC a licence to construct, own, operate and maintain the 100MW solar power plant with the first phase of the project expected to produce 50MW. Last year, the Environmental Management Agency approved the Environmental Impact Assessment report for the development of the 100MW Gwanda solar plant. “Subject to the Electricity Act and the terms and conditions of its licence, the licensee may supply electricity to any transmission, distribution or supply licensee who purchases electricity for resale and, with the approval of the authority, to any one or more consumers,” said Zera. ZPC has also applied to build another 100MW solar photovoltaic power plant at Insukamini in Matobo. At present, Zimbabwe’s electricity demand stands at an average of 1 400MW against generation capacity of 1 000MW. In October 2015, ZPC entered into a deal with Intratrek to construct the solar plant at a total cost of $202 million. Officials from ZPC have visited the Export-Import Bank of China to finalise funding discussion for the solar project. ZPC has commissioned Shanghai Electric Power Design Institute (SEPD), a subsidiary of energy giant Power China, to do the feasibility study. According to the SEPD feasibility study, Zimbabwe has total radiation of sunshine of between 2 500 and 4 000 hours per year. It has since been established that the Gwanda solar power project is feasible at a tariff rate of 18 cents per kilowatt hour. @thandyfeminine
