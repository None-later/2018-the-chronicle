Minister Prisca Mupfumira Fortunate Gora, Harare Bureau Maize traders who tamper with their scales to dupe farmers risk being arrested and should desist from the unscrupulous act, a Government official has said. Briefing Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Prisca Mupfumira at the Mashonaland West Agricultural Show in Chinhoyi during the weekend, Trade Measures regional inspector Mr Tawedzera Muwoni said his organisation has noted with concern the practice among some traders. Minister Mupfumira was the guest of honour during the agricultural show. Trade Measures is an arm of Government operating under the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Enterprising Development. The company goes around searching for such criminals and hand them over to the responsible authorities. “These criminals will tune their scales to give a false reading, for example, a bag weighing 20 kilogrammes will weigh 15 kilogrammes on the scale meaning that the farmer will be duped the other five kilogrammes,” he said. Mr Muwoni said many people were not aware of these criminals yet they have flooded the country. He said Trade Measures had also picked some anomalies at fuel filling stations where filters have been tampered with. Meanwhile, Mashonalnd West Provincial police spokesperson Inspector Clemence Mabweazara also told Minister Mupfumira that the ZRP was committed to providing the most effective and efficient policing service to the public. “We are maintaining a database for corruption cases, both inside and outside of the organisation and we are generating strategies to combat the scourge,” he said. Minister Mupfumira urged the police to continue maintaining law and order to ensure the socio-economic development of the people.
