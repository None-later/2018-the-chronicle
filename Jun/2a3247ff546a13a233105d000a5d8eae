 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Volleyball Association (ZVA) promotional play-offs ended at White City Stadium on Sunday with Nust and Black Rhinos men’s teams sealing spots in this year’s National League. ZVA National League is a competition that started in 2012, replacing the Club Championships, which were played using a tournament format over one weekend. The league draws elite clubs from around Zimbabwe in both genders to fight for the right to represent the country in the regional Zone VI Club Championships. At the weekend, champions of the country’s provincial leagues converged in the City of Kings to fight for four promotion slots up for grabs. Black Rhinos, Nust, Chinhoyi University (Cut) and Parrots battled it out in the men’s category, while Hurricanes, Parrots and Chinhoyi University squared off in the ladies’ division. Hurricanes emerged tops in the ladies’ group after the round robin. They beat Cut 3-1 and Parrots from Triangle 3-0 to earn their ticket to the league. Cut emerged second with a 3-0 win over Parrots to join Hurricanes in the league. The men’s category had a different format to the ladies, with Black Rhinos from Harare clashing with Parrots in the semi-final and emerging 3-0 victors. The other semi-final saw Nust beating Cut 3-1 to book a final against Black Rhinos. Black Rhinos won the final 3-1 and qualified together with Nust. Newly appointed National League chairperson Khanyile Dlamini said: “We are already working on the schedule in anticipation of the league’s start next month. The league will run up to October as we search for teams to represent the country at the Zone VI Club Championships. We expect to have a competitive and exciting league.” Results Men: Semi finals: Rhinos 3 – 0 Parrots, Nust 3 – 1 Cut Final: Rhinos 3 – 1 Nust Women: Cut 1 – 3 Hurricanes, Hurricanes 3 – 0 Parrots, Parrots 0 – 3 Cut
