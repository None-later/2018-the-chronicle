 Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief ZVISHAVANE town council has budgeted $1,2 million towards the rehabilitation of 10 kilometres of roads in Mandava and Makwasha high density areas. Town secretary Mr Tinoda Mukutu said the rehabilitation work was almost complete. He said the exercise covers road resealing and was progressing well after the local authority contracted Bitumen World Construction Company to do the work. This follows termination of a road sealing and resealing contract it had awarded to Madz Contractors over poor performance. The contractor reportedly spent 14 months doing nothing after being awarded tender for the project on May 26 last year. “Road resurfacing is now half way done in Mandava and Makwasha high density areas following the awarding of a tender to Bitumen World Construction Company. “The cost for this exercise is $1,2 million and is coming from Zimbabwe National Road Administration (Zinara) and from our own source, that is our own account,” he said. “They are doing a good job actually. They started about two weeks ago and are almost half way with the resealing of the 10km of the targeted roads.” Mr Mukutu said most roads in Mandava and Makwasha suburbs have outlived their lifespan and needed major rehabilitation work. He said some of the roads in the high density areas were damaged by heavy rains at the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, Mr Mukutu said council had spent about $400 000 buying construction equipment to improve service delivery. “To improve service delivery in the town, we are in the process of procuring construction equipment at a cost of about $400 000. We want a motorised grader, at least two tippers, one dozer and one roller. As I speak, we have received a new fire tender and these will go a long way in improving service delivery,” he said.
