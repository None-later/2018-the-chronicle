 Yemurai Ushamba, Chronicle Reporter A MARRIED police officer from Buchwa Police Station in Mberengwa has been dragged to court for the upkeep of one minor child by his ex-girlfriend who is also a police officer. Ms Rudo Moyo stationed at Fairbridge Police Station was demanding $100 from her ex-boyfriend Maxwell Togara. “I earn $250 a month because I took loans. I am also taking care of my other minor child who is seven years old. I am requesting $100 for the child’s upkeep,” she said. Togara who is paying maintenance for another child offered $50 for the upkeep of his fourteen-month old daughter. “Last year before I moved to Buchwa we agreed that I will give her $50 for the child every month. My net salary is $290 a month since I have loans that I am still servicing. I have a wife and two other children. I am paying $130 maintenance for the other child because my wife dragged me to court,” he said. Ms Moyo rejected the offer of $50. Bulawayo magistrate Miss Rachel Mukanga ordered Togara to pay $70 for the upkeep of his minor child. “You are paying $130 for the other child. Why are you offering $60 for her child? You are ordered to pay $70 for the upkeep of your child until she is 18 years or is self supportive,” she said. Meanwhile a Bulawayo man has also been dragged to court by his ex-wife suing him for child support. Ms Sibonokuhle Mpofu was demanding $200 from Edson Ncube for the upkeep of his two children aged nine and five years old. @YUshamba
