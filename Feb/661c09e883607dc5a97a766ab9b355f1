Teenage Hadebe TEENAGE Hadebe is happy that Kaizer Chiefs’ defence is staying solid, saying that Daniel Cardoso is their leader and most vocal member of the back four. The Amakhosi have now kept 14 clean sheets in all competitions this season following their 1-0 win over Cape Town City last weekend, but the 22-year-old insists that they’re just doing their job. Chiefs take on Bloemfontein Celtic on Saturday night as they look to try and close the gap on log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns, and Hadebe, who is a doubt for this weekend due to an ankle injury, thinks that Siwelele should be scared of taking on the Glamour Boys on their home turf. He told the club’s official website: “Defending is about not conceding goals and that’s what we focus on in every game… Daniel is the leader (of the defence). We have a lot of respect for Celtic, however, any team that comes to FNB Stadium should be scared of us. We need the three points.” Meanwhile, when asked about Chiefs’ title ambitions, the Zimbabwean said they’re focusing on their immediate future. “It’s too early to talk about that. There are still nine league matches left. We must take it one game at a time and keep focused.” — Soccer Laduma
