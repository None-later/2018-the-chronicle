Ruti Olajugbagbe Ruti Olajugbagbe has won The Voice UK 2018, shrugging off stiff competition from Bulawayo-bred Donel Mangena. Ruti burst into tears when her name was called out and looked completely stunned. Totally lost for words, Ruti said of her debut single – a cover of Dreams by The Cranberries that is now available to stream: ‘I wasn’t expecting it to be so soon, I didn’t expect to get the final. I didn’t expect the coaches to turn.’ For winning, the 18-year-old Ruti bagged herself a record deal with Polydor and a prize money of £100 000. Despite coming runner up, Donel was very happy to have got so far. He told host Emma Willis: “Thank you so much. I’ve loved every second of it. To have come runner up, it’s amazing. Working with will.i.am has been my highlight. I’m so happy, as happy as Ruti.” In the live final, Ruti performed a duet with Tom – a beautiful version of What A Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong. She also performed Daniel Bedingfield’s If You’re Not The One. Earlier in the evening, operatic duo Belle Voci – which is made up of Emily and Sophie – performed a stunning rendition of My Heart Will Go On with their mentor Jennifer Hudson whilst Olly Murs took to the stage to duet with Lauren Bannon. Donel’s father, Nkosana Mangena thanked people for supporting his son and wrote: “Donel is my Hero!!!” on his Facebook page. – DigitalSpy
