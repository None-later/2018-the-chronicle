 Pamela Shumba/Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporters The African Union (AU) has deployed five independent electoral assistance missions to provide technical support to Zec ahead of the harmonised polls. In a statement, AU, Department of Political Affairs Principal Advisor Mr Robert Gerenge said the five were deployed on June 15 and will be in the country until July 8. “The Department of Political Affairs of the African Union Commission (AUC) has deployed a five persons’ independent electoral assistance mission in Zimbabwe from 15 June 2018 to 8 July 2018 to provide technical support to the Zec. The mission has been deployed in response to the request for technical assistance made by the Zec during the visit to Zimbabwe by the AUC leadership in February 2018 led by the Chairperson, His Excellency Moussa Faki Mahamat,” said Mr Gerenge. The deployment of the AU team is in fulfilment of Article 18 of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance (ACDEG) which mandates the AU to provide assistance to electoral bodies upon request by member states. Zimbabwe became an ACDEG signatory in April this year and Mr Gerenge said the technical assistance team is in the country to help Zec prepare for free and fair election. “The main objective of the mission is to assist the Election Management Body (EMB) in organising democratic, credible and peaceful elections in Zimbabwe on 30 July 2018 in line with international, continental and regional norms, standards and values,” he said. “The mission will focus on capacity building training for the EMB personnel on various aspects of electoral operations. This entails training of trainers in management of polling processes which the AUC will support in cascading up to the constituency level.” — @pamelashumba1/@nqotshili
