Rodwell Dhlakama Lovemore Zigara in Gweru PREMIERSHIP side Chapungu have dispelled rumours linking their technical manager Rodwell Dhlakama with topflight teams in Swaziland. Dhlakama is in Swaziland and has been spotted at Manzini Wanderers, heightening speculation that he could trek back to his former club. There are other clubs in the Swazi Kingdom that are also reportedly interested in his services. However, Dhlakama who is employed by the Air Force of Zimbabwe is still to be cleared by his paymasters and they remain adamant that his is still Chapungu’s technical manager. “(Rodwell) Dhlakama is still in the Chapungu structures and we are still to meet as an executive to discuss his issue. Once that happens we will apprise you and will make an announcement on the issue,” said Chapungu chairman Pious Maketo. “He is still with the club and he remains in our plans for the forthcoming season and since this is off season, I am sure he is enjoying the holidays,” he added. Efforts to get a comment from Dhlakama were futile as he was not responding to WhatsApp messages sent to him. The former national Under-17 team coach has been in Swaziland since last week and has been spotted at Manzini Wanderers training sessions. He has had two coaching stints in Swaziland, first with Sundowns during which he won two trophies before a short stint with Green Mamba. Dhlakama was roped in as the Chapungu technical manager last season from sister side Blue Swallows where he was the head coach. He came to “Waru Waru” at a time the club was winless and managed to help the team to finish eleventh in the eighteen team league.— @lavuzigara1
