Njabulo Ncube Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter SIX Bulawayo teams are competing in the Bonsa Spar sponsored winter T20 cricket tournament at the Old Mutual Heath Streak Cricket Academy. The competition started on Sunday and will end with the final on August 26. Players are drawn from the Bulawayo Metropolitan Cricket Association’s leagues and the competition is aimed at keeping local cricketers active since very little action takes place on the domestic front. Duncan Frost, the Bonsa Spar T20 cricket tournament director, said they are expecting tight competition from the participants, which guarantees quality entertainment for the game’s lovers. “Bonsa Spar are sponsoring the nine-week winter cricket T20 competition to give an opportunity to most guys that were not involved in top class cricket. This tournament is good in the sense that it gives the guys a chance to keep active during the off-season. We have six teams made up of 15 players each, which translates to 90 guys competing in this tournament,” said Frost. The six teams are Badgers, Hawks, Raptors, Tigers, Blazers and Sabres. Some cricketers that turn out for provincial franchise side Tuskers that have registered to participate in the T20 are John Nyumbu, Cunningham Ncube, Ainsley Ndlovu, Thabo Mboyi and Njabulo Ncube.
