 Yemurai Ushamba, Court Reporter A BULAWAYO man has been arraigned for allegedly kidnapping a 3-year-old child for over five hours. A court heard that Onias Dube (46) of Cowdray Park is a commuter omnibus driver and that he transports children to school. He allegedly dropped the other children at their homes but failed to drop the minor until 9PM. Dube pleaded not guilty to kidnapping charges before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Stephen Ndlovu and was remanded in custody to August 7. “I did not kidnap the child. When I got to his house there was no one present and I had to go with the child. I became occupied with a lot of things and I forgot to go back and check if there was anyone in the house. I literally forgot the child was still in the car,” said Dube. When asked how he forgot that the child was still in the car, Dube went mum. The prosecutor, Mr Mufaro Mageza said on Monday at around 4PM, Dube proceeded to Praise Pre-School and picked up the minor whom he was supposed to ferry from town to Cowdray Park where he resides. “Upon arrival at Cowdray Park he delivered all the other children who were in the car, except the minor. He detained the minor up to 9PM instead of taking him to his place of residence,” said Mr Mageza. The court heard that a missing report  was filed and investigations led to Dube’s arrest and the minor was found in his car.—@YUshamba.
