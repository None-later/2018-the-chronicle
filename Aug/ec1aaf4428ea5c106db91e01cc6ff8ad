Mr Mazango Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter BAKERS Inn general manager Mr Felix Vazhure has retired after serving the confectionery company for 14 years in that capacity. In an interview, Bakers Inn chief executive officer Mr Ngoni Mazango said Mr Vazhure left the organisation at the end of last month. The former Bakers Inn general manager for the southern region has since been replaced by Mr Precious Mpofu who has also been with the company for years. “Mr Vazhure has left Bakers Inn after reaching retirement age and had served Bakers Inn for a very long time from the time he joined the organisation in 2004 as general manager for the Southern region,” he said. “He has since been replaced by Mr Precious Mpofu who has also been with Bakers Inn southern region for a very long time.” The Bakers Inn boss said Mr Vazhure was retiring to focus on farming at his farm in Mashonaland. “He served the organisation very well and was a hard working leader, a mentor and all those attributes which are positive point to the fact that he was a real leader,” said Mr Mazango. Bakers Inn is part of the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange-listed quick service restaurant business, Simbisa Brands, which in June announced plans to expand its operations by opening two outlets in Kwekwe soon. It is hoped that the opening of the two outlets will add impetus to the fast food chain as it seeks to maintain market dominance locally. Apart from Bakers Inn, Simbisa Brands also operates Nando’s, Chicken Inn, Creamy Inn, Steers, Fish Inn and Pizza Inn across the country employing about 3 000 workers. In February, the listed fast food chain also announced plans to acquire an international restaurant group subject to shareholders’ and regulatory approvals. Its expansion drive dates back to 2015 when it was unbundled from Innscor Africa Limited. Simbisa operates in nine countries in Africa with Zimbabwe enjoying a 45 percent market share of the 413 outlets it has mainly in the Sub-Saharan region. @okazunga
