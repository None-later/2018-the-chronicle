Leeknotic is famed for Thanyela a Gqom track ft TKP and hit track, Tshibilika where he was featured by Sandra Ndebele. For the latest release, the house artiste roped in the services of contemporary musician Hwabaraty who launched his highly acclaimed album Isilwane last year. Kuze Kuyevalwa is an Afro-dance track that was co-produced by Leeknotic and Jay-Dot in Harare, but was recorded at the Afro Platinum Music Studios in  Bulawayo. Leeknotic said he hoped the song would be a club banger until year end as they went all out with its production. “Kuze Kuyevalwa is my first track this year and as the song suggests in IsiNdebele, I want this track to be one that lasts until the end of the year. When I produced it, I wanted it to be played at every party and nightclub in Zimbabwe and I’m confident it’ll be able to do so,” Leeknotic said. He described the track as a feel good tune that has a traditional feel that was brought by Hwabaraty. Hwabaraty “I included Hwabaraty to add that traditional music flavour that he is known for. He’s the one who came up with the title Kuze Kuyevalwa. “It all worked out well and this has inspired us to want to collaborate more.” Leeknotic, an Afro-house musician and producer, signed under Afro Platinum Music will be performing at the Gqom Life Gardens tomorrow where he will perform the new offering. In order to promote the song, the artiste said they were now gathering funds so that they can shoot a music video for the song with the hope of getting it played on international TV stations.
