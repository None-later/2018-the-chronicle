Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter AMATEUR golfers taking part in the Dugmore Golf tournament at the Bulawayo Golf Course that tees off tomorrow will have to endure a dry course due to lack of rains. A field of 100 amateur golfers are expected to take part in the tourney that heralds the start of the country’s golfing season, but Bulawayo Golf Club manager Phillip McDemott said the ball will be moving a lot due to the dry fairways. “The course is not bad, but due to poor rains, it’s a bit dry, although it’s not in bad condition. The youngsters, who will take to the course, will probably have the ball running a lot. We still expect good scores though,” said McDemott. The tournament will use individual stroke play over the 54-hole course. Stroke play involves counting the total number of strokes taken on each hole during a given round, or series of rounds. The winner is the player that takes the fewest strokes over the course of the round or rounds. Last year, the season opener was postponed several times due to heavy rains that pounded the city and it was eventually held in April, a move that saw it attracting fewer golfers. The event will see several top amateurs converge for the competition, which also carries with it the Windhoek Lager Green Jacket points. A three-member Zimbabwe team will be on the course at the Golf and Country Club in Namibia for the Windhoek Lager Africa Jacket Golf Championship, which will also draw participants from Botswana, South Africa and Zambia from June 5-9. The three amateurs will compete for points in five qualifying tournaments, the Dugmore Trophy, Julius Robinson Trophy, Mawegu Amateur Championship, Masvingo Open as well as the Rowland Park Open. — @skhumoyo2000
