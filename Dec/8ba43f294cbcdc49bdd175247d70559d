PREPARATIONS for the second edition of the Skyz Metro FM Music Awards (SKYMas) are at an advanced stage with organisers saying more than 40 000 votes have been cast. The awards will be held at the Large City Hall this Friday. Leading the pack of nominees this year are artistes Clement Magwaza, Sandra Ndebele and Novuyo Seagirl with three nods each. Maskhandi musicians Zinjaziyamluma and Indlamuva, rapper Asaph, Afro Soul musician Thami Khumalo, gospel singers Mai Mwamuka and Knowledge Nkiwane have two each. Other nominated artistes are Cal_Vin, Guluva 7, Ndux Junior, Nceku, Allen Ndoda, Djembe Monks and Indosakusa among many others. Last year, Zinja Ziyamluma was the biggest winner as he walked away with two awards for the Best Mas’khandi/Mbaqanga Song and Skyz Metro FM Ingwebu People’s Choice Best Male Artiste. Other winners were Madlela Sikhobokobo, Khuxxman, Magwaza, Prudence Mabhena, Jeys Marabini, Abigail Mwembe and Lorraine Stot among others. Skyz Metro FM station manager, Godwin Phiri, said they were geared up for this year’s awards ceremony adding that more than 40 000 votes have been cast for the various nominees in 13 categories. “What’s great about the nominations this year is that people can only vote once on our website because a person is required to use their email address,” said Phiri. He said they were now finalising the line-up of performers. “Those who didn’t perform after the abandonment of this year’s Umcimbi Wabantu might be our headline acts. We’re, however, still finalising the line-up and it’ll be out tomorrow (today), most probably,” said Phiri. Clement Magwaza and Madlela Sikhobokobo are the ones who did not perform at Umcimbi Wabantu as the event, which also served as Skyz Metro FM’s second anniversary celebrations, ended prematurely following a power cut.
