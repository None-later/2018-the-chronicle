 We kindly ask Econet Wireless to sort out our network problems in Bulawayo. For the last two weeks the network is very bad. One can hardly converse clearly as the calls keep breaking in the midst of a conversation. Efforts to contact them to look into the matter have proved fruitless. â€” Disgruntled Customer, Mula, Bulawayo
