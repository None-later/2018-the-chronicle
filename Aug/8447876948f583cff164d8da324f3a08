 Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter THE stage is set for the Kezi inaugural four-team soccer tournament to be played today at Bango Semukwe Bridge under Chief Bango. St Joseph’s FC, Mambale, Khalanyoni and Bango Swallows will battle for the top honours in the tournament that is bankrolled by the United Kingdom-based quartet of Amkela Dube, Clayton Vundla, Obey Maphosa and Siza Ndebele. The main drive of the tournament is to inspire up-and-coming footballers from the area to take the sport seriously and possibly earn a living through playing football. Forster Ncube, Bango coach said his charges are ready and is confident that they will lift the winners’ trophy. “The boys are raring to go and we thank the sponsors for organising this tournament so that the players have something to play for. The rivalry between the four teams is huge and as the hosts, our aim is to win the tournament and make our supporters proud,” said Ncube. The winners will pocket R4 000, with the losing finalists getting R1 500 while the third team gets R250. Busani Ndebele, the St Joseph’s coach said: “We are geared up for the tournament and the boys are eager to show off their capabilities. I think it will be a good day for football and we are ready to face any team.” The four teams will know their opponents after the draw which will be conducted before the games start this morning. Spokesman for the organisers, Dube, who is also one of the sponsors, said they want the competition to be an annual event. “Everything is set for the tournament, we’ve bought the medals and the trophies are here. It will be a good day not only for the aspiring footballers but the community as a whole. We know that football is a universal sport and as such we decided to use it to promote social cohesion, fight crime, stop abuse of alcohol and anti-social behaviour,” said Dube. —@ZililoR
