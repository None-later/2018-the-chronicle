Dumiso Dabengwa Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent ZAPU president Dr Dumiso Dabengwa yesterday said former President Robert Mugabe should tell the truth about the post-independence disturbances instead of hiding behind the statement that it was a moment of madness. Dr Dabengwa’s remarks follow Cde Mugabe’s claims last week to selected local and foreign journalists that Zapu and Zipra were to blame for the 1980s disturbances that occurred in the Matabeleland and Midlands provinces. The former President was previously asked to apologise over the matter, but only declared it a moment of madness that should never happen. In an interview yesterday, Dr Dabengwa, who was jailed for five years during the period, said Mr Mugabe should come clean on the disturbances. “I think he should be coming out and telling the truth. He should have apologised about it instead of calling it a moment of madness. What madness? Is he still mad up to this day?” asked Dr Dabengwa. “Other people apologised. Cde Zvobgo (late Eddison) made an apology as he was involved in the planning of the operation.” While the former President is stuck in denial over the issue, President Emmerson Mnangagwa in January signed the National Peace and Reconciliation Commission Bill into an Act empowering the commission to conduct its duties. The NPRC is expected to consult members of the public and come up with recommendations for the Government in addressing issues relating to political violence. President Mnangagwa has assigned his deputy Cde Kembo Mohadi to lead the Peace and Reconciliation portfolio which is expected to address issues such as the disturbances. The President has also engaged traditional leaders from Matabeleland to address the issue. @nqotshili
