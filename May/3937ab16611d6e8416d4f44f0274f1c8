Turkish anti-riot police in Istanbul have arrested over 50 people and placed a security lockdown on the Turkish metropolis as the city marked the International Labour Day, known as the May Day. According to state-run Anadolu news agency, at least 52 people were detained as they were attempting to defy a ban on holding demonstrations in the city’s key protest locations, including the Taksim Square, yesterday. The annual workers’ holiday in the Anatolian country has traditionally been a time that workers, unsatisfied with the working conditions, stage demonstrations, leading to confrontation between protesters and police. However, in recent years authorities have left nothing to chance by completely barring access to key protest areas. — PressTV.
