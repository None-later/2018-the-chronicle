Dr Desire Sibanda Auxilia Katongomara, Chronicle Reporter GOVERNMENT has commended traditional leaders in Matabeleland North for pushing for the setting up of a teachers’ college in the province. Matabeleland North is the only province in the country without a teachers’ college. The permanent secretary in the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development, Dr Desire Sibanda praised Chief Mtshane Khumalo and Chief Nhlanhla Felix Ndiweni from Ntabazinduna for pushing for the establishment of a teachers’ college in the province. Officiating at Hillside Teachers’ College graduation last week, Dr Sibanda asked the chiefs to stand up and hailed them for the initiative. “These chiefs invited us a month ago to come into this region to talk about education and setting up of a college in this part of the area. “I want to thank them in a very special way and to mention that it’s very rare for chiefs to have such an interest in the education of their children,” said Dr Sibanda. He said last month they had a special meeting with the chiefs who were calling for the establishment of a teachers’ college in their provinces. “I find that a blessed thing to do. When you see us building more colleges here, remember this occasion,” said Dr Sibanda. In an interview after the graduation ceremony, Dr Sibanda said there had been a proposal to convert Ntabazinduna Vocational Training Centre into a teachers’ college. “We agreed with the chiefs that we are going to talk to the Ministry of Youths and see if we can convert Ntabazinduna Vocational Training Centre into a teachers’ college. The chiefs felt that not many of their children were training as teachers because there was no teachers’ college in the province,” he said. Chief Ndiweni said Ntabazinduna Vocational Training Centre was being underutilised hence the proposal for it to be turned into a teachers’ college. @AuxiliaK
