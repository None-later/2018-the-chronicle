 Natasha Chamba, Business Reporter TELECOMS giant, Econet, says its EcoSure Moovah vehicle insurance scheme has recorded a positive number of clients a few weeks after its launch on the market. EcoSure Moovah is the insurance arm of Cassava Zimbabwe, which also houses Ecocash, the leading mobile money service. At its launch, management had pledged to make the scheme a blockbuster that would rival major brands such as EcoCash and other insurers in the motor industry. A senior Econet executive, Mr Darlington Mandivenga, said scores of vehicle owners have embraced the new service and more were expected to subscribe. “By making it cheaper, more convenient to pay and also bundling with other products, I can tell you EcoSure Moovah has taken the market by storm,” he said. “EcoSure would like not only to grow to serve a major share of the market, but it wants to help tens of thousands of car owners get proper insurance instead of breaking the law by driving uninsured vehicles. We predict our clientele will rise as we approach the insurance season in October.” Mr Mandivenga said estimates showed that there were more than 700 000 uninsured, privately owned vehicles on Zimbabwe’s roads, and EcoSure Moovah wanted to make sure they were licensed. He said technology and innovation were the two key drivers of the EcoSure strategy capable of reaching every vehicle user in Zimbabwe. “Using the Econet distribution platform, EcoSure can reach virtually every car user in the country, with the added advantage of being able to bundle several benefits into its offering, using innovation and existing products” Mr Mandivenga said. Econet’s Cassava FinTech Zimbabwe executive Mr Eddie Chibi said the service was making great strides in the industry as it offers flexibility. “EcoSure Moovah offers choice and flexibility through the option of customers to pay their premiums monthly, but it also offers incredible value addition through bundled benefits of up to $5 000 at very competitive and affordable premiums, and this flexibility is important in the insurance industry,” he said. @queentauruszw
