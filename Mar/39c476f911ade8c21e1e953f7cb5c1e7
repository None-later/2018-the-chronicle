Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior, Sports Reporter FIVE teams from the Golden Oldies Social Football League will this Saturday clash in a tournament organised by Amavevane Club at Milton High School. The social teams, Izinsizwa, Isigubhu, PPC, National University of Science and Technology (Nust) as well as hosts Amavevane will fight it out in a round robin format for the first prize of a live goat. “This is part of our means of celebrating the Easter holidays and we have invited these teams to come over and socialise. The event will actually start on Friday with a live band at our Ascot Club House before the football tournament on the following day,” said Amavevane secretary general, Justice              Dube. One of the few social clubs, if not the only one in the country with a fully functioning club house, Amavevane commands a lot of respect in the social football circles and have also produced a number of football stars that have gone on to play for Highlanders, Motor Action as well as abroad and the national team. With strong links to Highlanders, some of its members are respectable business people in the country. “Our season is on a break and this tournament affords us an opportunity to mingle and exchange notes with our counterparts. It’s not only about social football or the prize on offer but linkages as well,” said Dube. Former Highlanders stars Joel Luphahla, Sizabantu Khoza, Dazy Kapenya and Thabani Masawi turn out for Amavevane. — @skhumoyo2000.
