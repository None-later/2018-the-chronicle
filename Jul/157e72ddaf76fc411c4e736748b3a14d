Through your widely read newspaper, I would like to ask Tegela residents to vote wisely in the coming elections.  I am sure they realise that we do not have a councillor.  She does not know our suburb exists.  Let us elect a person who will think about us during the coming term of office.  Our area is run down,  the streets get a bit of attention along Airport Road during Trade Fair period. The rest of the suburb is not thought about. Our youths are toiling.  There is litter everywhere. No more street lights except near Airport Road.  Roads are gone.  There is no grass cutting done except along Airport Road. Huge trees which are council responsibility are wild. The councillor does not visit the area, has no programmes for the community.  Time we give our vote to a new face. — Angry Registered Voter and Tegela Resident, Bulawayo Comment to Education Unions.  You must mind your own business.  Represent the teachers not the army.  You are civilians and soldiers are not.  So stay away from army issues as we stay away from yours. Keep your hands off our issues. — RTM, Army Lawyer and Chaplain, Gwanda
