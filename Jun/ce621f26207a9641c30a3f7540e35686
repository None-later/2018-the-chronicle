 Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent Popular nightspot, Club Connect in Bulawayo has shutdown. Its proprietor, Biggie Chinoperekwei said they were planning to relocate it to another venue in the city as the current location was not conducive for the clientele they were targeting. The club that was situated at Cecil Hotel was opened two years ago and will be remembered for hosting the likes of Zodwa Wabantu, DJ Tira, Distruction Boyz, DJ Shimza, Jah Prayzah, Soul Jah Love and Ammara Brown among many other artistes. The nightspot was once the place to be for patrons around the city because of its VIP booths, sassy hostesses and the glitzy lifestyle. Many of the city’s memorable nights were made at that club. The joint is no longer as popular as the numbers of revellera patronising it have drastically dropped. In a bid to woo back patrons, the joint removed the $5 cover charge but this did not help the situation.The final straw was probably at the beginning of the year when the joint hosted DJ Shimza, a huge South African act but only a handful of fans attended the show. Even when Andy Muridzo launched his album, not many people came. According to Chinoperekwei, they realised that the location did not augur well with the people they wanted to attract. “Club Connect is moving from downtown to uptown. We’ve identified a venue, but as of now, we can’t reveal where it is. We realised that people complained that although they liked Connect, it was located just outside the CBD,” said Chinoperekwei. He said Club Connect in Bulawayo will be ready to open its doors in time for the summer season. The new venue he said, will have spacious and safe parking space. “The new venue will be ready to open in time for summer. We’re already working on bringing a big artiste for the grand opening.” Meanwhile, Club Connect in Livingstone in Zambia is still operational with another outlet set to be opened in Harare towards the end of next month.
