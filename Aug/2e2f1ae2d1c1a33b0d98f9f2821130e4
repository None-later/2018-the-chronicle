The absence of top players from the tournament presents unheralded players with an opportunity to win a major title and put themselves in contention for the end of year Bulawayo Candidates tournament for the top 10 players, including those who  won BCA organised competitions during the year. Players expected to capitalise on the absence of the stars include Spencer Moyo of Filabusi Chess Club, Nust’s Nigel Mabiza, the Bulawayo Polytechnic pair of Maxwell Masare and Ayanda Ndlovu as well as youngster Mlungisi Mafu.
