Cde Ezra Chadzamira Walter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent THE Zanu-PF leadership in Masvingo province has said people aspiring to participate in parliamentary and council elections on the party’s ticket should have a clean record to avoid the “capture” of the party. Masvingo provincial chairman Cde Ezra Chadzamira said the province was expecting to field candidates with an appreciation of the values and ethos of the revolutionary party. “We are expecting to have people who know the values of Zanu-PF and have clean track records. We do not expect to have divisive leaders who are known enemies of the party,” said Cde Chadzamira. He said some aspiring candidates had a “bad history” as they were dining and wining with the enemy, especially those who belonged to the ousted G40 cabal. “This time around, we do not want to have leaders who will create problems for the party once they are in power. To achieve this, we will be thoroughly vetting all aspiring candidates in readiness for the primary elections expected any time this month. “The greatest fear that we have is to be led by G40 members who had captured our structures before we were saved by Operation Restore Legacy,” he said. “There is no crime in developing one’s area and we will not stop those who have started engaging in developmental projects. However, it should be incumbent on all aspiring candidates that they should have clean records to avoid their curriculum vitae being rejected.” Addressing a provincial coordinating committee meeting at Masvingo Polytechnic recently, deputy national political commissar Cde Omega Hungwe said the party would only accept CVs from members who would have undergone training at Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology. The school is the party’s initiative led by the Commissariat to train Zanu-PF members so that they appreciate its values, principles and ethos.-@walterbmswazie3
