Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Showbiz Correspondent PLUMTREE entertainment company — Toundtainment that has made a name for itself by hosting South African actors in the town – is planning to give back to the community by embarking on a fundraising programme where they hope to raise funds to support the Plumtree District Hospital maternity and children’s wards. As part of these efforts, Toundtainnment spokesperson, Handsome Sibanda, said they would be holding a birthday bash for renowned Plumtree DJ Yugoe in Johannesburg this Saturday followed by another bash in Plumtree on June 9. The celebrations will be held under the theme “Party for a cause”. “We are holding this event in a bid to raise funds for the Plumtree District Hospital maternity and children’s wards. The funds that we’ll raise from this event will be used to buy blankets, bed sheets and clothing for both wards. “The party will first be held in Johannesburg on Saturday while the second leg will be held in Plumtree. Local DJs and some based in Johannesburg will provide entertainment in South Africa while local entertainers will take care of business in Plumtree,” Sibanda said. Sibanda said the initiative was a way of giving back to the community for supporting their events over the past years. He said the birthday party would be held annually with proceeds set to go to charity. “DJ Yugoe came up with the idea to hold a fundraising event on his birthday and we incorporated it as Toundtainment and also invited local youths to play a part. The event will be held annually under the theme ‘Party for a cause’. “Under this theme, we’re emphasising that entertainment isn’t only about having fun, but it can also be a tool for development. We also want to nurture a culture of social responsibility among our artists,” he said. @DubeMatutu
