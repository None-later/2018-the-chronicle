 Sukoluhle Ndlovu, Midlands Correspondent A TWO-YEAR-OLD boy from Mponda Village in Shurugwi died from suffocation while his two siblings watched helplessly in a botched fontanelle (inkanda/nhova) treatment by his mother. It is a strong belief in some African traditions that a child is likely to die if their fontanelle is not “treated” at an early age. The incident, which has shocked villagers, happened on Saturday night. The mother, Jennifer Madidi (31), has since appeared before Shurugwi , Mr Tavengwa Sangster, charged with the murder of her two-year-old son. She was not asked to plead when she appeared in court and was remanded in custody to June 20. Magistrate Sangster advised Madidi to apply for bail at the High Court. It is the State case that on June 2, Madidi prepared a salt and cooking oil solution intending to treat her three children’s fontanelles. She put drops of the solution into her children’s ears. Upon finishing, she dipped her right thumb into the solution and inserted the thumb into her two-year-old son’s mouth. She pressed the thumb continuously until the baby suffocated and died while the other siblings watched. Madidi sustained bite marks from the now deceased. She immediately informed her neighbours who ferried the body to Shurugwi District Hospital. The matter was reported to the police leading to Madidi’s arrest. Miss Bertha Bore represented the State. @sukusinini
