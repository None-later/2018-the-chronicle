Rodwell Dhlakama Lovemore Zigara in Gweru AIRMEN Chapungu entertain Harare giants, Caps United, at Ascot Stadium tomorrow in a Castle Lager Premiership encounter seeking a positive result in their quest to avoid relegation. Chapungu are fourth from bottom with 13 points from 16 games and a victory will see them going into the midseason break with some relief, depending on results involving neighbours Nichrut and Dynamos. The Gweru side go into today’s match smarting from a 0-3 away loss to Yadah. Chapungu coach Rodwell Dhlakama says his side needs to turn the tide if it entertains chances of avoiding relegation. “We are playing at home and of late we have not been picking points. We are facing a very good Caps United side and we need to be at our best. For us, we just need to pick up, even a draw will be good for us as it will at least bring our confidence back,” he said. The airmen will be looking for inspiration from ageless Phillip Marufu who has been one of the club’s most consistent performers while the trio of Allen Tavarwisa, Ian Nyoni and Blessing Sahondo can win a game for the airmen any day. However, it is going to be a tall order for the airmen to overcome a Green Machine side which takes no prisoners and is comfortable playing at home or away. Lloyd Chitembwe’s Caps United charges have only lost once in the last four games, going down 1-2 at home to Mutare City Rovers a fortnight ago. The Green Machine will be buoyed by the fact that they have a good record playing at Ascot Stadium. — @lavuzigara1
