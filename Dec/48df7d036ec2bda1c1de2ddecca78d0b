Government has called on road users to exercise caution on the roads to reduce accidents during the festive season. In a statement, the Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development, Engineer Joel Biggie Matiza, urged motorists not to drink and drive and to observe road regulations to avoid loss of life. “We are once again in the festive season, a time for celebration of Christmas and New Year’s holidays. A time to visit friends and relatives throughout the country. A time also, for merry-making. I therefore, urge all our road users to use the roads carefully and observe road regulations,” said Eng Matiza. “Zimbabwe is committed to the United Nations declared Decade of Action for Road Safety which envisages a reduction in road traffic deaths by 50 percent by 2020. Indeed we can reduce road deaths in Zimbabwe by 50 percent or even better, if we play our part.” The Minister said both public service operators and private motorists must not use vehicles that are not roadworthy. “My expectation is that operators of public service vehicles will provide a safe and timeous service which should see everybody being transported to their destination safely. Operators are also strongly urged to desist from the habit of overworking their drivers resulting in failure to adhere to their time tables,” he said. More than 250 people died during the previous festive season, statistics from the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe (TSCZ) show. Last December had the highest number of crashes at 5 175, resulting in 240 deaths and 1 357 injuries. In 2017, a total of 1 838 deaths were recorded, while 10 489 people were injured in 42 430 crashes that occurred in 2017, translating to 153 deaths monthly, the TSCZ said. This festive season the TSCZ will be carrying out campaigns on the country’s roads as it scales up efforts to reduce road accidents. —@esinathy_essira
