 Nyaradzo Bakari, Chronicle Reporter A BULAWAYO man who has been dragged to court by his wife who is demanding extra money for their children’s maintenance, has revealed that his wife is abusive. Bernard Mlilo told Bulawayo magistrate Miss Sharon Rosemani that his wife, Ms Sithembile Moyo, was violent and that is why he sometimes flees from home. “I can testify as I stand here that she beats me every now and then. So I have to run away from home, especially when I have received my salary because I will be scared she will assault me. I was injured on one hand so I can’t fight back that’s why I run away,” he said. Ms Moyo dismissed the allegations, saying she doesn’t assault him but they fight. She said Mlilo was a drunkard who disappears from home to squander money on beer. “That’s a lie. I do not beat him up but we fight. I can show you the scars I have from the wounds inflicted by him. He is running away from the fact that he disappears when he gets his salary just to go and spend the money on alcohol. As we speak, he disappeared from home on Tuesday, only to resurface today. He even smells of alcohol,” she said. Ms Moyo demanded an upward variation of maintenance for their two children; one in Form Two and the other one in Form Three from $80 to $150. The magistrate ordered Mlilo to pay an extra $20 for maintenance and buy school uniforms for the children. “The respondent makes about $120 a month so the applicant’s application for $150 is not reasonable. The respondent works for the money, so he has to benefit from the salary too. I also considered that the applicant’s reasons for the variation are valid,’ she said. “So the respondent will pay $100 for two minors with effect from May. He will also buy full sets of school uniforms for the children twice a year.” — @NyarieBakie
