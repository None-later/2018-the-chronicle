 Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent AN unknown man was found hanging from a tree in Bulawayo’s Pumula East suburb on Wednesday evening amid suspicions that he could have committed suicide. Bulawayo police spokesperson Inspector Precious Simango confirmed the sudden death. She said the identity of the suspected suicide victim was not known. “Police attended to a suspected suicide in Pumula East suburb on Wednesday evening. A male adult is suspected to have hanged himself on a tree using copper cables. His identity has not been ascertained and his body has been taken to United Bulawayo Hospitals for post mortem,” she said. Insp Simango said the police did not suspect foul play. She encouraged residents to carry their national identification documents so that they are easily identified in case of mishaps. Insp Simango said police were worried by the rising suicide cases in the city. “We call on residents facing challenges to seek counselling services instead of taking their lives. They should engage elders in society, church leaders or even approach the police so that they can be assisted,” said Insp Simango.
