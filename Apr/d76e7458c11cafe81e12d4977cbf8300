Nkululeko Nkala Showbiz Correspondent WITH eight days left before nominations close for the second edition of the Bulawayo Arts Awards (BAA), organisers say they are overwhelmed by the response from the public. The BAAs will be held on May 26 at the Large City Hall with the deadline for entries being April 12. From January this year, the public has been nominating online, artistes whom they want to be considered for the 50 awards in 12 categories. Over 800 nominations and submissions have been cast so far on the website. BAA spokesperson Nkululeko Nkala said their website actually crashed last week because of the high volume of traffic. “The website crashed last week because there were a lot of people nominating their favourite artistes as the deadline draws closer. We’ve since fixed the problem and the website is up so people can continue nominating,” said Nkala. Tickets to the award ceremony have also gone on sale with Nkala saying there were only 1 200 tickets available because of the sitting capacity of the venue. The tickets cost between $10 and $25. “We have 270 ordinary tickets costing $10 each, 330 VIP going for $15 and 600 VVIP tickets being sold for $25.” Nominees who will be shortlisted by a panel of judges are set to be unveiled on April 28 at the Bulawayo Theatre.
