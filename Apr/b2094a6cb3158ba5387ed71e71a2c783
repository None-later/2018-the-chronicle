Lovemore Zigara in Gweru FIREWORKS are expected tomorrow when FC Lesaffre takes on former premiership side Whawha in the Zimbabwe General Medical Aid Fund Central Region Soccer League (ZGMAF-CSL) encounter at Wilson Fields. The two sides had a perfect start to the season both winning their opening two games. FC Lesaffre who are in their debut season in the ZGMAF-CSL are second to Whawha on the table. On the other hand, Chekera Pasi has been on a rampage having scored seven goals as they clobbered Blanket Mine 4–0 before walloping FC Platinum Under 19  3–1 last weekend. Both sides are exercising caution as they are coming into this game. “We are still new in the league and ours is a learning curve hence we do not have any pressure on our side. We respect Whawha as a club with a good track record in the league but we will try to come with a result come Sunday,” said Lesaffre assistant coach, Jackson Office. Luke Petros-Jukulile, the Prisons and Correctional Services side coach said his opponents are good, judging by their positive start to the season. “They are a new team in the league and judging by their results so far, they are a team to look out for.  We are, however, prepared for them. All we need to do is to remain focused and optimistic in our last two matches and hope for the best,” he said. Elsewhere, Jairos Tapera will have his first game in charge of Sheasham when the expensively assembled side travel to Gwanda for a date with Blanket Mine.
