Prince Sunduzani, Business Reporter A BULAWAYO taxi association, Expricoss Taxis, is set to acquire passenger coaches in a bid to increase its market share and create employment for locals. In an interview on the sidelines of a handover ceremony of streetlights to the Bulawayo City Council, Expricoss Taxis chairperson, Mr Mpikelelo Khumalo, said the company was already in talks with its funders for the expansion project. “As a taxi association we are looking to grow our business even bigger. At the moment we are talking to our funders for us to realise this. Obviously when one is in any business he would want to grow so we will be looking at bigger vehicles and coaches, just like what others do in neighbouring countries like Zambia,” said Mr Khumalo. He said their association was looking at the boom in the taxi industry following the resuscitation of the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ). Last month, President Mnangagwa received on behalf of the Government, the first batch of leased railway equipment from South Africa. The resuscitation of NRZ is expected to boost different businesses in Bulawayo and the country as a whole. “We are expecting NRZ to employ people and these people will be coming to Bulawayo. Also there will be increased number in passengers and this means that movement will increase. This will in turn translate into more business for us as transport industry players,” said Mr Khumalo. The taxi association handed over to BCC streetlights worth $3000 as part of its corporate social responsibility. Mr Khumalo said the gesture was meant to improve the city’s lighting so as to reduce criminal activities that are associated with the darkness. @PrinceNkosy102
