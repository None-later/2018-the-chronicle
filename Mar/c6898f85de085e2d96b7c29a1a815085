Grewe, who is a specialist on the topics and a visiting lecturer at Nust, will address the one hour lecture that has been facilitated by the Department of Sports Science and Coaching at the university. The lecture begins at the Nust Ceremonial Hall at 9AM. Bhekuzulu Khumalo, a lecturer in the Department of Sports Science and Coaching, called on those in the sport industry to attend the lecture. “Modern day sport requires one to fully understand how the body operates. Metabolism, for example, is the process by which your body converts what you eat and drink into energy. Metabolism plays a major role in most performances and can explain a large part of performance in many sports. “The lecture will also help in understanding the body recovery process, how to train the body properly amongst other important aspects of maintaining a healthy sporting body. “We encourage people in the sport industry to come in their numbers and attend what we expect to be an enlightening lecture. We invite lectures, students, athletes, coaches, health advisors and practitioners to come and join us,” said Khumalo.
