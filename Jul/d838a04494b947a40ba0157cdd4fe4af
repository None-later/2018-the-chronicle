Raisedon Baya Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent ORGANISERS of the annual Intwasa Arts Festival koBulawayo say artistes hoping to participate at this year’s fete will be expected to fully fund their own shows as organisers are facing financial challenges. This year’s edition will be held from September 26 to 29 under the theme ‘Realities and Experiences’ with organisers saying they are seeking partnerships with artistes in order to make the event a success. Festival director Raisedon Baya said they have made a call for artistes to submit proposals. He said due to budget constraints, they were looking for partnerships with artistes. “We want to work with artists that have finished products and these products should be of high quality. Also, we want to work with artistes in a collaborative manner where they can add value to the festival by paying for venues, publicity and the like,” said Baya. “This year, unfortunately artistes shouldn’t expect the festival to do everything for them.” He said in applying for space at the festival, artistes should take into consideration this year’s theme. “The Realities and Experiences we’re talking about are in terms of socio-economic and socio-political issues from 1980 until now. There’re so many things that have happened in our country. “We want artwork that’ll engage the public and have a lasting effect,” said Baya. At the end of this month, Baya said they would start working on the festival’s programme. “The programme will be out after a month. We have groups that have submitted stuff to us, but this call is for us to cast our net wide.” Artistes have therefore been urged to send their proposals to the festival’s email address info@intwasa.org in order to exhibit their works at the event.
