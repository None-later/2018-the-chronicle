Ba Shupi and Stunner Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent The usually sleepy town of Gokwe is expected to spring to life today when Desmond Chideme alias Stunner and rapper Ba Shupi, born Peace Ndlovu, clash in the cotton growing town. The duo, popular for their collabo on Godo, are expected to reunite in the cotton growing town where they will headline the Gokwe Spar Magic Moments Fun Run. Gokwe folks will get a rare opportunity of mixing and mingling with the two artistes before they take to the stage and later at the after-party. Gokwe Spar Magic Moments director Tinashe Mangisi said all is set for the event’s second edition. “Of course Stunner and Ba Shupi are the main acts but we also have a lot in store for the Gokwe people on the day. We will have a lot of entertainment lined up for the day for both the young and the old,” he said. To kick-start the proceedings will be the 20 kilometre marathon and the 10 kilometre walk. For children, there will be jumping castles while adults will enjoy braai, beach soccer, pool, tug of war, Five-A-side beach soccer, darts and chess among others. Mangisi said all proceeds will be channelled towards charity adding they were targeting more people to attend making it bigger and better. “We are targeting about 800 people or more. The idea was mooted (because of) the need to raise something for our local old people’s homes and orphanages,” said Mangisi. He said there would be free tuberculosis and diabetes testing on the side-lines in a bid to promote health and fitness among people. “We partnered many stakeholders like Gokwe Hospital who will be conducting various tests on the side-lines,” he said. There will also be lots of prizes to be won with the marathon winner expected to walk away $500 richer.
