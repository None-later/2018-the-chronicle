Prosecuting, Mr Nkathazo Dlodlo said the 14 were arrested last Friday. “On March 23 at around 8PM, detectives from CID Homicide received information that there was a Toyota Quantum being driven by Mthabisi Ncube loaded with illegal immigrants from Somalia and Kenya enroute to South Africa,” Mr Dlodlo said. “Detectives intercepted the motor vehicle at Esigodini toll gate along the Bulawayo-Gwanda road and identified themselves. The 18 occupants were asked to identify themselves and they all failed as it was later discovered that they were all foreigners without valid travel documents leading to their arrest.” @MondelaC
