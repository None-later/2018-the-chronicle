 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS men pipped the National University of Science and Technology (Nust A) 47-46 in a closely contested basketball league encounter at Khanyisile Sports Centre at the  weekend. Bosso were in action for the first time since the league’s festive break and the victory saw them taking their points tally to 13. It was the second defeat for Nust A in the second half of the season after they lost 48-65 to title favourites Oilers a few weeks ago. Nust A coach Tatenda Mumbengegwi attributed their narrow defeat to fatigue on the part of his charges. “The game was exciting and challenging at the same time. I was impressed with the way the boys played. “We controlled the game from the start, but in the fourth quarter we got tired and fatigue crept in. “It was a close game that could have gone either way in the fourth quarter, but unfortunately, the result went the other way,” said Mumbengegwi. His opposite number Theo Weale was delighted with the performance of his inexperienced players. Bosso lost a number of players during the mid-season break and had to promote a number of young players into the senior team. In the women’s division, Highlanders women were trounced 13-85 by a ruthless Lakers Seniors. Lakers, runners-up in 2017, top the table and remain undefeated in eight encounters. Defending women’s champions Southern Mavericks cruised to a 60-15 victory over Divas.
