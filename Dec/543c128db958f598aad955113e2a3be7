The anti-malaria strategies being employed by Government and its partners are paying dividends as evidenced by the drastic drop of malaria deaths from 402 last year to only 100 this year. The Ministry of Health and Child Care national malaria programme manager Dr Joseph Mberi said new malaria cases have gone down by 50 percent. “I am glad to say that the number of new cases that we normally record have gone down from about 30 per 100 000 people to about 15 which is a good sign. The anti-malaria spraying is in full swing and we hope to complete it by December 22,” said Dr Mberi. He, however, said the anti-malaria teams were struggling to reach other districts due to fuel shortages. “We are working very hard to ensure that by December 22 we are done with spraying. At the moment we have been slowed down by fuel shortages but we are hopeful the situation will improve to enable us to cover all districts before December 22,” he said. — @thamamoe .
