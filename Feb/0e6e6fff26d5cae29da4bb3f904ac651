Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter Defending champions Giants hope to keep the pressure on log leaders Southern Mavericks when they face high riding Oilers in a Bulawayo Basketball Association league match at Khanyisile Sports Centre tomorrow afternoon. Giants are second on the table with 16 points from nine games, just a point adrift of Southern Mavericks, who take on Highlanders in another potentially explosive encounter at the weekend. Giants have made it clear that their objective is to defend their title and beating one of the strongest teams in the league Oilers would underline their championship credentials. Oilers have been in top form during this campaign and have only lost a single game this season. That defeat came at the hands of Highlanders, who narrowly edged them 55-62 a fortnight ago. Oilers are fourth with 15 points from eight games and will be hoping to get one over their rivals to ensure they do not lose ground in the title race. Action begins today with women’s action when Lupane State University face Lakers Seniors in what should be an exciting game ahead of the men’s encounter pitting Nust and LSU. Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Basketball Association held a two-day officiating workshop in Kwekwe last weekend aimed at improving the standard of refereeing in the country. Referees from around Zimbabwe attended the workshop.
