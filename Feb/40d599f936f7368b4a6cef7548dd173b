 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Bulawayo Basketball Association (BBA) has begun preparations for the inter-provincial competitions to be held in Gweru next month. The association’s first step towards ensuring Bulawayo teams bring back gold from the games was the announcement of a strong technical team to take charge of the teams. Sinda Mono has been appointed head of the technical team, with the senior team’s head coach for men being Highlanders’ Theo Weale and Mxolisi Ndlovu taking charge of the women. In the Under-18 category, head coach for the girls is Mthulisi Makhosana assisted by Lerule Smith, while Jonah Vumah will take charge of the boys assisted by Simba Mbengegwi. BBA secretary-general Admire Chafa said they were working hard to ensure the teams adequately prepare for the tournament. “We are working right round the clock to make sure that the tournament is a success for our province. In view of forthcoming continental competitions, we hope to have more players from this region in the national team. “The senior teams are already having weekend training camps and we expect to assemble our strongest squads so that we bring back gold. I believe we have assembled one of the strongest technical teams,” said Chafa. “For the juniors we tried to incorporate people from National Association of Secondary Heads (Nash) and National Association of Primary Heads (Naph), such as Vuma and Makhosana from Nash and Ellen Ngwenya, the headmistress of Sigombe Primary School. “The schools play a very crucial role because this is where most of the talent comes from.” The tournament will offer players an opportunity to make the national team grade.
