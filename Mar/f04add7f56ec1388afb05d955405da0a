 Sports Reporter THE Bulawayo Chess Association (BCA) will hold a two-day arbitration and coaching workshop at Nust on Good Friday. The clinic, targeting primary and secondary school teachers, comes a month after BCA held a similar programme that had over 100 participants. The workshop, which is targeting mostly teachers, is meant to prepare participants for an international certification by the World Chess Federation (Fide). Fide arbiters Moses Mutipforo of Bulawayo and Kwekwe’s Wilfred Sithole were the course facilitators at last month’s programme held at Girls College. “We had a good turnout at the last course and teachers from Bulawayo and surrounding provinces have asked us to provide another workshop. The training is in line with our schools’ programme, meant to equip chess trainers with skills in arbitration and coaching. BCA has been running many tournaments and we have noticed a big deficit in chess officiating and coaching and we want to arrest that. “It is our hope that since it will be a holiday, school teachers will come in their numbers. Deadline for registration is Thursday, March 29 and the programme will be held on March 30 and 31,” said Mutipforo. Bulawayo has two Fide certified arbiters, Mutipforo and Thabang Moyo as well as Fide trainer Melzedeck Masimba. Meanwhile, BCA registration for the BCA annual Easter tournament has opened and closes on Friday. The Easter tournament, whose defending champion is ZRP Bulawayo’s Sifiso Ncube, will be held on April 1 to 2.
