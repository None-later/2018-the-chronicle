 Michelle Gwizi, Court Reporter A PROPHET from Entumbane in Bulawayo was ordered to leave a courtroom and return when he was more rational after offering $20 for the upkeep of his minor child. Princess Sibanda was demanding $60 from her ex-husband Jethro Mvundla for the upkeep of their one-year-nine-months old daughter. “I am demanding $60 for the upkeep of our daughter. He is a prophet and I know he can afford it since he realises more than $400 a month,” she said. Mvundla offered $20 saying he is not employed. Bulawayo magistrate Mr Tinashe Tashaya ordered Mvundla to leave the courtroom and return with a reasonable offer. “Both of you go outside, discuss and come back a reasonable offer,” said Mr Tashaya. When Mvundla came back he offered $50 for child support. “I’m willing to try giving her $50 because l‘m not employed and I have other three children to support”. Bulawayo magistrate Mr Tinashe Tashaya ordered Mvundla to pay $55 for the upkeep of his minor child. “You will pay $55 for the minor child with effect from July 2018 until your child turns 18 or becomes self supportive. The money shall be deposited into the applicant’s account,” said Mr Tashaya.—@gwizi_n
