Mrs Nesisa Mpofu Yemurai Ushamba, Chronicle Reporter BULAWAYO City Council (BCC) is working on a programme to stop sewer leaks following an outcry by residents in a number of suburbs amid fears of disease outbreaks. BCC senior public relations officer Mrs Nesisa Mpofu said council has a programme to deal with the problem up to the end of this year. Mrs Mpofu urged residents to desist from dumping sanitary pads and other objects to prevent sewer blockages. She said residents should assist council by reporting vandalism cases and sewer spillages. “The City of Bulawayo sewer maintenance teams respond to chokes when calls are made through to the Council Call Centre. Council also has a contract that is currently running up-to the end of the year (2018) on clearing of difficult chokes especially in the bigger sewer lines,” said Mrs Mpofu. “The contractor has successfully cleared Luveve, parts of Mabutweni and work is in progress in some of the older suburbs in the city such as Entumbane, Pumula and Magwegwe. The second contract is targeting replacement of missing/stolen manhole covers. Manhole covers protect the sewer lines from above ground water inflows finding their way into the systems carrying with it soil that normally causes sewer blockages.” She said residents must not dump pampers, sanitary pads, cutlery, sand and newspapers through the council’s sewer system. “The people of Bulawayo should continue to support BCC by reporting incidents of vandalism and conveying accurate information on sewer spillages in the city,” said Mrs Mpofu. Her remarks come amid reports of unattended burst sewer pipes for two weeks in Bulawayo’s Old Lobengula suburb. Problems have also been reported in Luveve suburb and other areas. — @YUshamba
