Some of the shoe lines manufactured by Millennium Footwear in this file picture Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter BULAWAYO’S leading exotic shoe manufacturers, Millennium Footwear is stranded with 350 pairs of school shoes after a Zambian customer failed to pay for the order. The company’s director Mrs Sikhangezokuhle Simali told Business Chronicle that the order was made in November last year but the prospective client was not forthcoming to honour the agreement saying he was still sorting out finances. “We have tried to engage him but to no avail. We are now trying to sell them bit by bit and he (customer) has given us the reason that he is still sorting out his finances after the order was made in November last year,” she said. “The guy had placed an order of 500 pairs of school shoes worth $4 000 and we had produced 350 pairs, which we are now trying to sell.” Mrs Simali said some of the stock had been sold at the recently held Zimbabwe International Trade Fair. She appealed to organisations such as the Export Credit Guarantee of Zimbabwe to offer insurance that covers exporters against such risks. “So I think we need to work with the Export Credit Guarantee of Zimbabwe so that when somebody places an order we get a sort of a guarantee,” she said. The shoe manufacturer produces game leather products made of giraffe, elephant, ostrich, buffalo, and crocodile skins, among others. Last year, Millennium Footwear secured a trophy dealer’s licence, which allows it to trade in game products and gets its products from local tanneries. The firm is working on penetrating the regional export market to countries such as Zambia and Namibia. “We have been exporting to regional countries such as Zambia and Namibia but on a small scale during regional trade shows in the past two years,” said Mrs Simali. @okazunga
