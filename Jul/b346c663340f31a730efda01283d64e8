 THE fixture of the series between Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, which is set to be held in October, was confirmed by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Saturday. The Sylhet International Stadium will host its first ever Test match in the two-match Test series. The two-Test series will be preceded by a three-match one-day international series with the second and third games of the series played in Chittagong following the opener in Dhaka. According to the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s schedule, Zimbabwe will arrive in Bangladesh on October 16 and will play two practice games, a 50-over game, before the ODIs and a three-day game before the Tests. Sylhet’s addition to the Test match club will make it the eighth Test venue. There are currently five active Test venues in the country, with Chittagong, Fatullah, Dhaka and Khulna all having hosted Tests previously. The venue has thus far hosted only seven T20 Internationals games, with Zimbabwe themselves opening the ground to international action in a World T20 First Round Group game against Ireland in 2014. The ground most recently played host to a Bangladesh-Sri Lanka tie in February 2018. The bilateral series was originally scheduled to be played in January 2019. But a revision had to be made after the Bangladesh Premier League was moved to January to accommodate the general elections. — Bdcrictime.com
