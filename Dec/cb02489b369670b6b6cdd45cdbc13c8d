SIX teams from Matabeleland South will square off in the Thuthukani tournament that will be held at St Joseph’s Primary School in Kezi on Christmas Day. Despite showcasing rural talent, the tourney is meant to counter crime by keeping youths and fans occupied. The participating teams have been grouped into two pools with hosts St Joseph’s FC pitted against Maphisa based side The Venue and Ndolwane while Group B has Bango FC, Bhewula and Barcelona. All the teams contributed R2 000 each which adds up to R12 000 and the champions will walk away with R8 000. Tournament organiser, Busani Ndebele, who is also the coach for St Joseph’s, said the objective was to keep people occupied on Christmas Day. “During the festive season there are instances where we wake up on the Christmas Eve with murder cases, alcohol abuses and theft. “As a result we came up with this initiative to keep the youngsters out of such bad vices,” said Ndebele. Ndebele said they are working tirelessly to bring scouts from Bulawayo in order to expose the young players. “Youngsters need motivation and inspiration from other players who have made it in football,” he said. — @DecoDecent2
