DJ Skaiva Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent Award winning DJ Skaiva is travelling to South Africa to share the stage with the legends in the industry, Oskido and DJ Christos during that country’s Independence Day celebrations. DJ Skaiva, who is one of the Zimbabwe’s leading house music producers and wheel spinners, has carved out a name for himself in Bulawayo and Zimbabwe in general. There is hardly a show that involves a SA house DJ in the city that DJ Skaiva is not part of. The DJ’s influence seems to have extended south of the Limpopo where he will also perform alongside Black Motion during the Freedom Day on April 27 at Centurion Tshisanyama in Johannesburg. DJ Skaiva, who is known for his club banger Imali Yeqolo and the most recent hit Shingirira, said he was keyed up to be part of the bill and would showcase some of Zimbabwe’s house beats. “House music is big in SA and sharing the stage with legends such as Oskido and Christos is a dream come true. I’m excited. I want to impress and make people dance to some of my house music as well as other Zimbabwean music,” said DJ Skaiva. The DJ, who has had his song Sweet Jesus nominated at the Metro FM awards in 2015, said being booked in SA was a positive development in his music career. “Being part of the SA Freedom Day celebrations is a positive move for me as an artiste. It has always been my dream to be booked in SA. This platform will expose me to fans and promoters in the neighbouring country,” he said. DJ Skaiva paid tribute to Centurion Tshisanyama resident DJ Dipstaa for facilitating his booking. “DJ Dipstaa made all this happen, he’s the resident DJ there. We connected on social media and I sent him some of my music. He then told me of the booking two months ago,” said DJ Skaiva. He said as part of his plans to increase his influence in the industry, he was looking at doing collaborations in Zimbabwe and SA. @bonganinkunzi
