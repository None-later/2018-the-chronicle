 Lovemore Zigara, Business Correspondent GWERU City Council is set to roll out an automated parking system in May to replace the current manual prepaid parking system. The existing system has been roundly condemned by motorists as it is prone to manipulation which has resulted in indiscriminate clamping of cars. Council assistant director of finance Mr Owen Masimba said the new parking system will go a long way in addressing challenges highlighted by motorists. “We are now migrating to an automated parking system whereby sensors will be installed on parking bays and it will be able to take the details of the vehicle so much that we do not rely on the clamp like what has been happening,” said Mr Masimba. “Most of the complaints have to do with the visibility of our guys in the streets and we also appreciate that it is a problem. “We hope to have the rollout of the automated parking system by May this year and it is our belief that it will be for the convenience of our motorists,” he added. Zemqos has been awarded the tender to install the automated parking system. In 2014, Zemqos won the tender to install the automated parking system before it was cancelled by the State Procurement Board citing that the company did not meet the tender specifications. The new system is expected to plug out financial leakages through corruption which the local authority had been experiencing since the introduction of the prepaid parking system in 2013. In a special full council meeting held in April 2015, councillors noted that there were a number of irregularities in the council’s pre-paid parking system with some bordering on corrupt tendencies on pre-paid parking and clamping. It costs a dollar to park a car for an hour in the Central Business District. A motorist whose car is clamped pays a penalty of $30 and $80 in towing charge to recover their vehicle. @lavuzigara1
