 Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter GRASSROOTS Soccer peer educators yesterday started a two-day programme to educate the girl child about reproductive health at Sijawuke Secondary School in Bubi district. The Bulawayo-based organisation is using football to create a platform to educate girls on sexual reproductive health rights. The peer educators spokesperson Thandekile Mathobela said the objective is to empower the girl child to know her rights. “It’s mainly to do with empowering the girl child to know and appreciate her rights and building self esteem. “We also teach the girls how HIV is spread and we use soccer to preach this important gospel. “It’s really helping and they are willing to learn, which is what we want as Grassroots Soccer,” said Mathobela. Sijawuke Secondary School headmaster Cain Ncube welcomed the initiative by the organisation, which he said will not only empower the rural girl child, but the school as well. “We are excited as administrators of the school to have organisations like Grassroots Soccer coming to rural areas to empower girls. “The programme besides empowering the girl child, which by the way is their main objective, will also benefit the school in terms of resources like soccer balls and cones,” said Ncube. Grassroots Soccer is an adolescent health organisation that leverages the power of soccer to educate, inspire, and mobilise at-risk youths in developing countries to overcome their greatest health challenges, live healthier, more productive lives, and be agents for change in their communities. @skhumoyo2000
