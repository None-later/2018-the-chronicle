 Nyaradzo Bakari, Chronicle Reporter AFTER living for two years in perpetual agony, a granny from Bulawayo is appealing for help to raise $12 000 for total knee replacement on both legs. Donah Ncube (71) of Lobengula West suburb in Bulawayo underwent surgery to drain fluid from her knees in 2016 and has not been able to walk ever since. She said: “I developed a condition of swelling knees in 2016. When I went to the United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH), they operated on the knees and drained some fluids. That is when the situation got out of hand as I failed to walk. I have been living in excruciating pain ever since.” Ms Ncube said she has been living under the care of a maid as she cannot move on her own. “I have been forced to live like a baby who has everything done for them. I have resorted to living with a maid who assists me in moving, doing chores and everything I need because I cannot cope alone. This, however, isn’t enough as I pay her little money so sometimes I am forced to go for days without bathing as I have no one to help me do so,” she said. “I am appealing to well wishers who can help me raise $12 000 needed for surgery so that I can be able to walk again. My granddaughter is our sole breadwinner and she has been helping with paying the maid so raising the money for the surgery is quite difficult.” She said well-wishers can visit her at house number 72253 in Lobengula West or call her on 0776 132 617. @NyarieBakie
