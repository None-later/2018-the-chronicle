 Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter A 12-YEAR-OLD boy died on the spot while three other people were injured when a donkey drawn scotch cart they were travelling in hit a tree and overturned in Gwanda. Prince Dube of Makwe area under Chief Mathema was hit by the scotch cart as it overturned and he sustained serious head injuries leading to his death. The incident occurred at around 5PM on Tuesday near Makwe Business Centre. Matabeleland South acting police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Loveness Mangena confirmed the accident. “I can confirm we received a report of a fatal accident where a donkey drawn scotch cart hit a tree and overturned. It threw out all the four boys and as it landed, it seriously injured one of the minors. A 12-year-old boy who sustained serious head injuries died on the spot,” she said. The boy’s body was taken to Gwanda District Hospital for post mortem. Asst Insp Mangena urged members of the public to exercise caution when using scotch carts to avoid loss of life and injuries. She urged people to always lead animal drawn scotch carts. Asst Insp Mangena said animals can panic at any time when disturbed or can just choose to be wild at no notice. “It is sad to note that we continue to lose lives in scotch cart mishaps despite our warnings for people to exercise caution when using them. We also encourage adults to always be on the lead and never make children drive a scotch cart alone,” she said. — @winnie_masara
