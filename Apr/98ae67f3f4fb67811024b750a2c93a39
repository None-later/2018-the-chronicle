 Codelia Mondela, Court Reporter A WOMAN from Mangwe who allegedly set her husband on fire after an argument over a bucket of sorghum has appeared before a Bulawayo magistrate in a bedside court session at the United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH). Mr Franklin Mkhwananzi did not ask Monica Nxumalo (50) to plead to murder and remanded her in custody to April 30. Nxumalo’s husband, Alphos Moyo (57) died at UBH in Bulawayo last week as a result of burns sustained in the callous attack. Appearing for the State at UBH on Monday, Mr Nkathazo Dlodlo alleged that the two had a misunderstanding on April 4. He said Nxumalo took a 20litre plastic container which had petrol in it and poured it into the room where Moyo was seated drinking beer. “She lit a match and set alight the room and was seen by the housemaid. Moyo suffered burns all over the body and Nxumalo was also burnt in the process,” he said. Moyo had accused his wife of giving her sister a bucket of sorghum and some groceries while he was away in South Africa. “Monica took petrol which was in a 20 litre container and poured it on the floor. She struck a match and threw it into the pool of petrol. Her skirt also caught fire and she fled to the bush in flames,” read a statement. A neighbour said they found Moyo ablaze, rolling on the ground while screaming that his wife had killed him for his riches. @MondelaC
