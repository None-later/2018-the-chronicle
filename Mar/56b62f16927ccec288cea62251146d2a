Midlands Reporter GWERU City Council (GCC) is owed over $1 million by the informal sector amid indications that operators are boycotting payment of rates and fees protesting over vending points. GCC spokesperson, Mr Manford Gambiza, said in an interview that vendors trading at undesignated points in the city were becoming a menace and cost the council in potential revenue. “Council is owed a total of $1 404 740.87 by the informal sector. The reason being that they are protesting the existence of vendors trading at illegal selling points like the pavements and from their vehicles. “So, they are saying why should we pay council when we have unregistered and illegal traders stealing their business?” he said. Mr Gambiza said council was collecting $97 082 from 3 442 registered vendors operating in Gweru per month. “We have 1 273 vendors in the CBD, 1 281 at Swift, 334 in Mkoba, 176 at Kombayi, 20 in Ascot and 9 in Mtapa bring a total to 3 442 of registered vendors,” he said, adding that council had invested over $10 000 in making of vending stalls and markets so as to provide places for the informal sector people to conduct their business.
