Fakhar Zaman became the first Pakistan batsman to score a double century in ODIs Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq added 304 runs for the first wicket in the fourth ODI in Bulawayo. This is the highest ever opening stand in ODIs, going past the 286 runs added by Sanath Jayasuriya and Upul Tharanga against England in 2006. This is also the highest partnership for any wicket for Pakistan, superseding the 263 runs added by Inzamam-ul-Haq and Aamer Sohail against New Zealand in 1994. Fakhar and Imam became only the fourth pair across teams to add 300 runs for any wicket in ODIs. They also struck their third individual ODI centuries each, making it only the seventh instance of both openers scoring centuries for Pakistan. The 323 combined runs scored by the two openers is the second most ever in ODIs and 90 runs more than Pakistan’s previous record. Fakhar became the first Pakistan player to score a double-century in ODIs and the sixth overall. The previous highest score for Pakistan was Saeed Anwar’s 194, against India in 1997. Fakhar now has 980 runs from just 17 innings in ODIs and averages 75.38. Five players have reached 1000 runs in ODIs from 21 innings and Fakhar needs just 20 runs from the next three innings to become the first to do it in 20 innings. Fakhar’s innings consisted of 24 fours and five sixes which is the most for Pakistan. Pakistan’s total of 399 is their highest team score in ODIs, going past the 385 runs they scored against Bangladesh in June 2010. This is only the fifth instance of any team putting together a total in excess of 300 while losing only one wicket. Sri Lanka have achieved this feat thrice earlier, but Pakistan’s score is the highest for any team going past the 362 for 1 made by India against Australia in 2013.
