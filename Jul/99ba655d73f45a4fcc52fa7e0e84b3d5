The Senator for Bulilima-Mangwe, Cde Simon Khaya Moyo, made the call while addressing hundreds of Zanu-PF supporters at Masendu and Tokwana business centres where he was drumming up support for Bulilima West aspiring Zanu-PF legislator, Cde Dingimuzi Phuthi. Cde Khaya Moyo, who is the party’s national spokesperson, said people’s aspirations should occupy the elected MPs including councillors. “Councillors should be working for the people and serve them not to cancel their programmes but push them to fruition. An MP also should not be any MP referred to as “Missing Person” in the constituency but work for the development of the people, “ he said. Cde Khaya Moyo said President Mnangagwa’s new dispensation was not a trial and error period but a development-oriented trajectory. “We had 20 years without Foreign Direct Investment (FDIs) but President ED’s Zimbabwe is open for business gospel has lured investors back to the country,” he said. Cde Khaya Moyo said the new dispensation had to amend the Indigenisation Act to attract investors. “Today we are saying come with your money and invest and make profits, it’s your money. Why should we take people’s money without working for it? When President ED came in he said let’s do away with some aspects of that Act. Now investors are flocking back into the country and stampeding to invest to develop our nation. This is because of President ED’s gospel of Zimbabwe is open for business,” he said. Cde Khaya Moyo said the Government in the new dispensation was working hard to improve the lives of citizens. @richardmuponde
