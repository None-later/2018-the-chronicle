 Babington Machingura, Midlands Reporter Music fans on Friday packed the Gweru Theatre auditorium to witness the launch of gospel/afro fusion musician Rabson Vunganai’s second album titled Ndezva Mwari. The eight-track album has songs such as Ndezva Mwari, Rudo, Terera which feature Sebastian Magacha and Andy Muridzo. The other songs are Mihla, Mukana, Misi yose, Kure naMwari and Nditungamire. Amai Patai – the Chiuyai hit-maker was first on stage followed by Travellers Band and Magacha. Then it was time for Vunganai who put up a sterling performance just after 10PM. Dressed in a black suit and a designer hat that matched the African attire worn by his four backing vocalists, Vunganai belted out songs like Terera and Nditungamire among others. Together with Magacha, they brought the house down when they performed the song Terera. Although Muridzo was missing in action, the two still managed to wow the audience. Minister of State for Midlands Provincial Affairs, Cde Owen Ncube encouraged youths to use their God given talents to change their environment. In a speech read on his behalf by one of the directors in his office Cde Clayton Diwa, Cde Ncube said: “Such music projects will, I am sure, help to enhance cohesion and balance in most of our undertakings in the New Dispensation. It is in the spirit of the new dispensation to see arts and culture shaping our intra and interpersonal relationships at local, regional and international levels,” he said. Cde Ncube also urged artists to be professional so that they make a livelihood out of their careers. “Arts should not be seen as just a means of entertaining other people but rather as a business that can change the livelihoods of artists as well as change the socio-economic environment of the country.” he said. Vunganai’s publicity manager, Dumisani Ndlovu thanked the Gweru community for supporting Vunganai saying more projects were in the pipeline.
