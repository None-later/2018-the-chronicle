 Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent COMPUTERISATION of Government services can stop illicit financial flows while increasing the Treasury’s revenues. The legislator for Chegutu West, Mr Dexter Nduna who is also the immediate past chairperson of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Transport and Infrastructural Development, said this during a National Assembly debate on Wednesday. He said he had an informed view that departments such as the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development have increased their revenue collections due to the implementation of electronic data capturing systems. “Your committee on Transport caused the revenue generation in the transport sector, in the insurance sector in particular of $121 million through just computerisation of third party insurance. He said due to computerisation, insurance revenue went to genuine insurance companies as opposed to touts on the streets who were selling fake insurance discs. He said the issue of continuing to be manually oriented, moribund and rudimental archaic and antiquated could not generate revenue for the country. “It cannot generate revenue for the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning.We need to embrace technology so that we do not further tax the unsuspecting, innocent citizens and do not further hike taxation and get what we want from what we already have,” he said. The Zimbabwe National Road Administration (Zinara) is one of the parastatals which increased its revenues after computerising its services. And this year, Zinara targets to collect and mobilise $290 million up from $202 million in 2017. Mr Nduna said embracing technology will reduce illicit cash flows and corruption in Government departments.  -@nqotshili.
