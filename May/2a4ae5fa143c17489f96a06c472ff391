 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter REGISTRATION for this year’s edition of the Bulawayo Community International half marathon set for White City Stadium on June 23 is now open. Registration fees have been pegged at $10 for the 21km race and $5 for the 10km and 5km races. The event is a recognised international half marathon that runs through Mpopoma, Sizinda, Tshabalala, Pelandaba, Magwegwe, Lobengula West and Njube suburbs. The race starts and ends at White City Stadium. A member of the organising committee Themba Mhlophe said they were expecting the event to be bigger this year. “We have started with our preparations for the meet in anticipation of a big and exciting event. This is an open event to all registered athletes in the country. It is an international road race recognised by the International Association of Athletics Federation IAAF, so we expect to have top athletes for this meet,” said Mhlophe. “As part of the main event, we will have a 5km health walk for those who can’t run, hence the name health walk. “There will be netball and other events on the day. This is a family event so the programme will accommodate everyone.” The event was started in 1995 by the Matabeleland North Athletics Board. The route was measured by the IAAF route marker in 1997.
