 Nonsikelelo Moyo, Showbiz Reporter A Victoria Falls based award winning poet, Obert Dube’s star continues to rise internationally as he has been invited for a training workshop in South Africa where he will come back as an anti piracy ambassador. Forty-one, as Dube is affectionately known because of his Lupane roots, was on cloud nine following the invite which he said is an opportunity that will catapult him to greater heights as he is set to launch his first ever musical-cum comedy album £ in the neighbouring country next month. Dube has released four poetry albums and is working on some singles which he plans to release later in the year as he ventures into Maskandi and house music. In an interview, Dube who is also appealing to the business community to assist him with travelling expenses, challenged artists to embrace technology and fight piracy. “I have been invited to the Global Digital Box Arts workshop scheduled for Saturday in Hillbrow, Johannesburg. The workshop is meant to equip artists with knowledge on the benefits of selling their products online,” he said. Dube said as long as artists are relucant to adopt new technology, they will never win the war against piracy. “We need to embrace the internet and learn how to sell our stuff online as this can help reduce the vice in the country,” he said. Dube advised artists not to take social media for granted as it provides a platform for marketing products. “That’s the avenue we have been lacking as artists so I think the workshop will help many artists. Our products are shared on WhatsApp for example and we get nothing out of it hence we need this training,” said Dube. He said after attending the workshop, he will look for platforms that he will use to impart the knowledge he gained to local artists. Dube, a 2011 NAMA awards winner, has toured South Africa and Botswana and has wowed people at weddings and other events with his jokes and poems. He also doubles as director of ceremonies. @nonsy_m
