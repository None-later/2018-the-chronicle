The late Tinago Descent Dube, Sports Reporter VETERAN boxer Ambrose Mlilo has hailed the government for catering for the funeral expenses of three-time Commonwealth champion Langton “Schoolboy” Tinago. Mlilo, a former Zimbabwe middleweight boxing champion, said this had brought hope to the sporting fraternity. “I’m inspired by what the government decided to do because the man (Tinago) deserves all the respect in the world. I would like to thank the Ministry (of Sports) for assisting and recognising a legend who has flown our flag high,” said Mlilo yesterday. He, however, challenged the government to put in place programmes that support all living sporting legends, as they had been good ambassadors for the country throughout their careers. “I’m not taking anything away from what the government has just done for the Tinago family, but it would be much appreciated if living sports legends are given the same recognition and attention they get during their glowing careers,” Mlilo said. He said Zimbabwe had a number of living legends that represented the country brilliantly on the global stage, but as soon as they retired, there’s nothing in place to help cushion their livelihoods. “I don’t know what’s wrong with our sporting industry because this goes beyond the confines of boxing. The poverty of someone who was once an inspiration to every kid is a tragedy to the nation. How do we expect young people to walk in our footsteps when they know that the end result is abject poverty?” said Mlilo.
