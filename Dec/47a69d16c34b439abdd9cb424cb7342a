GWANDA High School headmaster Arthur Maphosa was on Sunday elected the Confederation of Southern Africa Schools Sports Association (Cossasa) secretary-general at the organisation’s annual general assembly held in Windhoek, Namibia. Maphosa, who is the acting president of the National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) took over from Hilbertine Mbasuva of Namibia. An elated Maphosa said: “I’m humbled by this appointment. “It shows the region has confidence in me and our country Zimbabwe. For years as Johnson Madhuku was president, I was chef de mission of our Cossasa teams which dominated competitions. I guess this won me the admiration of member countries. I thank the former Cossasa and Nash president Madhuku. “His exemplary leadership earned Zimbabwe so much respect, hence I was nominated unopposed.” Madhuku quit the education field to pursue politics and is now the legislator for Bikita East. Namibia’s Solly Duiker replaced Madhuku as Cossasa president. Duiker served as the organisation’s vice-president (technical), a position that has been filled by Dino Dlamini of Eswatini. Other members of the new Cossasa board up to 2021 are vice-president (finance) Chipangano Tembo of Zambia, Lesotho’s Stanford Tlali, who will be responsible for constitutional matters, and Botswana’s Jonas Letsweletse, who took over the marketing portfolio. — @ZililoR
