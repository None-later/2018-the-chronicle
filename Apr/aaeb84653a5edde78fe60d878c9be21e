Lizwe Sweswe Mukudzei Chingwere, Harare Bureau FC PLATINUM stand-in coach Lizwe Sweswe is taking some positives from their shock defeat at the hands of modest Bulawayo Chiefs at Luveve over the weekend. The champions had won five matches and drawn one in their opening six league matches but they were given a rude awakening by the Premiership newboys who handed them a 2-0 defeat. Sweswe said the defeat was as a result of complacency among his boys. “We lost the match because of complacency, you can even tell that the guys were underrating the opponents but you cannot do that and you should not do that in modern football. “We have always told the players not to be complacent in matches against any opponent but now that they have lost because of complacency it is a blessing in disguise. ”It is still too early in the season and we have a lot of time to pick ourselves up and move on. “Now we are playing without the pressure of being called an unbeaten side and that is good for us. “I would have been worried if we had lost the match in the second half of the season when the fight for the championship will be stiff but now we should be able to recover and challenge for the title, which is our primary objective,” said Sweswe. Last year, when they won their maiden title, the Zvishavane miners only lost two league matches against Ngezi Platinum and Caps United.
