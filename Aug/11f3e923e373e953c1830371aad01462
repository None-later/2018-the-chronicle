Othnell “Mangoma” Moyo, Showbiz Correspondent WELL-travelled percussionist, Othnell “Mangoma” Moyo, will tomorrow launch Zimbabwe Ngoma/iNgungu Rhythms and Songs Book 1 to help safeguard music from Bulawayo Townships. The book will be launched at the Indaba Book Café. Mangoma said for the past 18 years, he has been building and playing Ngoma/INgungu and researching from colleagues and guardians of culture about rhythms, songs and the most suitable materials for drum building. “I embarked on a journey to preserve Zimbabwean Rhythms and Songs through music staff notation after having studied at the Music Crossroads Academy of Zimbabwe. “So the book documents Bulawayo Township Rhythms and Songs from the period 1995 to 2010 with every rhythm, song and technique written in musical staff notation. The book comes with a tutorial DVD,” said Mangoma. He said launching the book was a way of safe guarding songs and rhythms of Zimbabwe. “Launching the book is the beginning of a journey to safe guard our Rhythms and Songs through written documents. A journey that will see us as Artists contributing to the preservation of our heritage,” said Mangoma.
