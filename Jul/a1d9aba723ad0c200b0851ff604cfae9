Philip Chiyangwa Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE Women’s Football has “liberated” itself to independently operate outside Zifa president Phillip Chiyangwa’s Harare offices. The women’s desk, which has for years been housed at the national association’s offices, notified its members on Monday that it had new offices. “Zimbabwe Women’s Football offices are now based at No. 1 Caris Brooke, Eastlea Complex along Robert Mugabe Road, Harare,” reads the message. Some Zifa critics spoke about the “ejection” of the women’s desk on social media last month, alleging that the development was meant to kick out a “mole” who had been leaking information about the beleaguered association. They claimed women’s football administrator Theresa Maguraushe was suspected to be leaking confidential information from Zifa and she was forced to take leave before the women’s desk left. Zifa communications manager Xolisani Gwesela rubbished claims that they had “chucked out” the ladies. “Women’s soccer league is just like the Premier Soccer League and doesn’t mean that they have to operate at the Zifa office. They are just an affiliate. They moved out on their volition to look for a place where they can operate independently like Harare province and the Northern Region who operate outside Zifa head office. We’re a national association,” said Gwesela. Repeated efforts to get comments from Maguraushe were fruitless. The development may also see women’s football enjoying the Fifa grants directly meant for the development of their game. Unlike in the past where Zifa was responsible for the grant meant for women, it remains to be seen if the national football mother body will grant them the freedom to manage funds from the world football governing body without interference. @ZililoR
