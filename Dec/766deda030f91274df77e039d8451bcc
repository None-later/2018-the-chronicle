DJ Stavo will be in Bulawayo for a show at BAC Leisure Centre tomorrow evening. Dubbed the “Golden Party”, DJ Stavo will share the decks with DJs Ash Stylez and BAC resident DJs Dre, Star, Kananjo, Slamma, and Prince Eskhosini. Event organisers said doors will open at 6PM. Entry has been pegged at $5 before 10PM with $20 being charged for the VIP section. Speaking ahead of the event, Ash Stylez said he, together with his best friend Stavo, were looking forward to performing in the City of Kings. “It’s always a joy playing in Bulawayo. We look forward to a great night at BAC Leisure, a place we’ll be performing at for the first time,” Ash Stylez said. BAC Leisure Centre, which was recently reopened, has become one of the most popular nightspots in the city because of its ideal location and ambience. Raelyn Tunks, the club’s marketing executive, said: “BAC has been redefined to give an upmarket lifestyle to our customers. “We’re hosting and promoting local artistes such as DJ Stavo to give our patrons the ultimate entertainment and leisure experience in Bulawayo. We urge people to come in their numbers to watch DJ Stavo live in action.” After Stavo’s gig, BAC will hold the Castle Lite Extra Cold party on December 28 that will feature performances by several DJs. The dress code at the club, Tunks said, is smart casual with patrons advised to adhere to it to avoid embarrassment. DJ Stavo, who recently wedded, has a busy schedule this festive season as he will be playing at various spots nationwide. After the BAC gig, he will head to Kwekwe on Saturday where he has a show at Solomon’s Café. On December 22 he will be in Mutare and Liquids Bar in Masvingo on December 24.
