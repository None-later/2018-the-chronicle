She said daily they searched for the body until it was found after a week. “We had a group of people who were ready to assist, they demonstrated a unique heart in the search for Brian Umera who died on the 17th of November as a result of drowning in Lower Ncema dam in Esigodini. He was laid to rest on November 25 in Vumba, Manicaland province,” said Cde Ncube She said Gardner and his colleague used their own resources to search for the body of Umera. “We want to thank him and his colleague for the job well done.
