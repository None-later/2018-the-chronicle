Albert Nyathi On Tuesday, February 20, we carried a story “Mediocre” book author Albert Nyathi content with Nama decision. The article erroneously published books nominated for the Nama 16th edition as this year’s nominees including Albert Nyathi’s My Son. We apologise to authors Albert Nyathi, Farai Mungoshi and Farai Nyandoro as well as the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe for any embarrassment or inconveniences the error may have caused. — Editor.
