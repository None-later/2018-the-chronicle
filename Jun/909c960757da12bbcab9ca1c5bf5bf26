 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter KYLE College in Masvingo will play host to the Conference of Heads of Independent Schools (CHISZ) in Zimbabwe Under-20 soccer tournament that starts today. The CHISZ soccer tournament began in 2000 at Lomagundi College in Chinhoyi and has grown over the years with over 15 schools set to participate in this year’s competition. Teacher in charge of football at Kyle College Farai Muruwa said everything was set for the games to begin. “We are ready to host the competition, as everything is sailing smoothly in terms of preparations. We are hoping everything goes as planned. This is a big tournament equivalent to the Nash tournament held by the government schools,” said Muruwa. “Teams have started arriving and we expect to have an exciting tournament. We are going to have a delegation from the United States of America that will be scouting for talent. After the tournament we are going to come up with a side that will play in Germany, which is an opportunity of a life time,” he said. Defending champions Peterhouse, who have won the competition three times in a row, will be aiming for a record fourth win. They will, however, face stiff competition from the likes of Falcon College, St John’s College, Watershed College, Hillcrest College and Goldridge College.
