 Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter A TEENAGER from Tsholotsho has been arrested for unlawful termination of a six months old pregnancy using a fertiliser and water concoction. Alvina Moyo (18) of Makwakweni area under Chief Magama terminated the pregnancy some time towards the end of July and her stepmother, Ms Princess Ngwenya (40), reported her to the police. Moyo was arrested, referred to Tsholotsho District Hospital for medical examinations and will appear in court soon. Matabeleland North police spokesperson Chief Inspector Siphiwe Makonese confirmed the arrest of the suspect. “We arrested an 18-year-old female who drank a concoction of fertiliser and water to terminate her pregnancy. When her stepmother discovered the matter, she reported her to the police and investigations are still underway,” she said. Chief Insp Makonese warned females against unlawful termination of pregnancies. “Termination of pregnancy can result in death and we continue to lose women to that. Abortion is a serious crime which can land one in jail,” she said. A family member who preferred anonymity said sometime in April, the suspect told her friend that she was pregnant. “The friend notified the suspect’s family. The family engaged the man who had impregnated her and he acknowledged that he was aware of the pregnancy and promised to take care of the baby. “Last Sunday, Moyo told her friend that she was no longer pregnant and was now having her menstrual period. The friend told the suspect’s family and Ngwenya questioned her about the pregnancy,” said the family member. “She told them that she drunk a concoction of fertilizer mixed with water sometime in July in order to terminate the pregnancy.” A report was made to the police and the suspect was arrested. A medical examination conducted at Tsholotsho District Hospital confirmed that a crime had been committed. — @winnie_masara
