Snr Asst Comm Charity Charamba Thandeka Moyo, Chronicle Reporter Police in Bulawayo are investigating a case of vehicle theft where a tout allegedly sped off with a car worth R100 000. In a statement yesterday, national police spokesperson Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba said the incident occurred in Mzilikazi on January 16 at around 2PM. “A commuter omnibus conductor stole a Toyota Quantum after the driver gave him keys so that he could clean the vehicle. The driver retired to bed and made a report when he realised that the suspect had driven away with the car.” She urged motorists to be wary of persons that they avail their keys to as unscrupulous people may take advantage of that trust and steal their cars. Meanwhile, police are appealing for information that may lead them to the arrest of a person who killed a 47 year-old Esigodini man in January. The man was found dead and naked in Esigodini on January 17 this year by a passerby who informed elders. “Circumstances are that an 18-year-old female from Matolokisi area was walking along a path when she heard the sound of a groaning man from the bush. She informed a village elder who checked the scene and discovered the deceased lying naked on the ground,” said Snr Asst Comm Charamba. “There were signs of a struggle at the scene and his clothes were beside him.” She said the man died and his body was taken to United Bulawayo Hospitals where a post mortem was conducted. “Police are appealing for information that may lead to the arrest of the perpetrators of the offence. Anyone with information can contact the nearest police station.”  — @thamamoe
