Antonio Conte LONDON — Chelsea finally confirmed the sacking of title-winning manager Antonio Conte but the Blues opted for just 61 words in their statement as they failed to thank the Italian. Maurizio Sarri is now clear to take over from Conte with just 28 days until the start of the new English Premier League soccer season. The statement on the club’s website read: “During Antonio’s time at the club, we won our sixth league title and eighth FA Cup. “In the title winning season, the club set a then-record 30 wins in a 38-game Premier League season, as well as a club-record 13 consecutive league victories. “We wish Antonio every success in his future career.” Confusion dominated recent weeks as Conte, who was expected to leave the role after the FA Cup win, returned to take pre-season training at the start of the week. But yesterday, Eddie Newton and former goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini took charge of the session as Sarri prepares to take the reins. Chelsea eventually agreed a compensation package which could be worth up to £9million with Conte, who had one year left on his contract. Owner Roman Abramovich had hoped Conte would land another role in a bid to avoid paying his contract compensation but the fiery Italian held firm and rejected the advances of interested clubs to see out his current deal. The Blues are in the process of clearing out his backroom staff so former Napoli boss Sarri can start ahead of the first pre-season fixture in Australia a week on Monday. Gianfranco Zola will return to Chelsea on Sarri’s staff. Conte’s position has been under scrutiny since the middle of last season when relations with the board became strained amid a feeble title defence. The 48-year-old ostracised a number of big players in the dressing room, including Diego Costa before he was eventually sold to Atletico Madrid, and the discontent has seen stars refuse to commit their futures. — Mail Online
