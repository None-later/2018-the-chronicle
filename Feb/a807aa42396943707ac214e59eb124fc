Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief Two chrome smelting plants, which are expected to employ more than 600 workers, are under construction in the Zvishavane-Ngezi constituency. In an interview yesterday, Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency Cde John Holder said the chrome smelters were being set up along the Zvishavane-Shurugwi Highway, where there are huge chrome deposits. The projects, he said, were likely to positively impact on the socio-economic development of the community and surrounding areas. “I am delighted to note that 2018 has started on a high note for Zvishavane-Ngezi constituency in terms of development because as we speak, we have two chrome smelting plants, which have a combined employment figure of 600, being constructed,” said Cde Holder. “The two smelters are going to bring employment and development to this area, Midlands province and the country at large.” Cde Holder said Zvishavane-Ngezi constituency had rich chrome deposits among other minerals which were going to bring the much-needed development in the area. He said names of the companies constructing the smelters would be revealed in due course, adding that they were expected to be operating by the end of next month. Cde Holder commended the new political dispensation for continuing to lay the foundation for investments. He said his constituency had received funding from the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate for rehabilitating four dams and sinking four boreholes. “We got funding from the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate for the rehabilitation of four dams in Zvishavane-Ngezi constituency,” said Cde Holder. “The dams once rehabilitated will provide water for irrigation and domestic use by villagers. At the same time, we are also drilling four boreholes so that villagers have safe drinking water as enshrined in the Constitution.”
