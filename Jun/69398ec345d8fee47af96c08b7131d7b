Mr Winos Dube Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent BULAWAYO United Residents’ Association (Bura) chairperson Mr Winos Dube has been charmed by the reformed Zanu-PF and will represent the party in the July 30 elections where he will be contesting for a seat in council. Mr Dube will be contesting in Ward 25. In an interview, Mr Dube, who has been at the helm of the oldest residents’ association in the city, said he was running for political office to fight for residents’ issues in council chambers. “This year I’m standing for election. It’s high time I really take a position, fighting for issues that are really affecting residents in a changed position from the position I have been holding for sometime as residents association leader,” he said. “I felt this time around I have to go straight into the board of a local authority and take a seat in council and see how best we can tackle things. We have been raising complaints now and again. We now feel why don’t we get in and see if we can make a change.” Mr Dube said he was contesting on a Zanu-PF ticket having been attracted by the new look ruling party under President Mnangagwa. “I’m actually standing under Zanu-PF and I’m doing this through a realisation that I totally respect the changes that have happened within Zanu-PF and signs where it is heading,” he said. Mr Dube said Zanu-PF is a tried and tested party whose policies have resonated with the electorate for a very long time. He said the party needs cadres who will push forward its development agenda and he is one such man. “It’s an organisation that has been there, what it needs is people that will stand honestly and fight for issues. Zanu-PF policies are quite clear, they just need someone who will put them into reality and make them effective,” Mr Dube said. He is yet to resign as Bura chairperson and might call it quits in October when his term ends. @nqotshili
