Professor Amon Murwira Thandeka Moyo, Chronicle Reporter Government has approved proposals to construct and refurbish tertiary institutions at a cost of $1,5 billion, a Cabinet Minister has said. In an interview, Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development Minister Professor Amon Murwira said more than 10 institutions are set to benefit from this initiative meant to improve infrastructure at institutions of higher learning. He said Gwanda State University was one of the institutions to be prioritised under the project. “We have a vision of developing institutional infrastructure that makes Zimbabwe competitive in the 21st century and beyond,” said Prof Murwira. “We have confirmed projects that will cost $1,5 billion being funded by private investors across the country,” he said. According to Prof Murwira, Bulawayo Polytechnic, Lupane State University, Gwanda State University and other tertiary institutions that are yet to be built like in Manicaland will benefit from the project. “The decision by Government to invite other players to complement its efforts to provide the required infrastructure at institutions of higher learning, is meant to speed up the provision of these facilities,” said Prof Murwira. He said the objective under the project was to provide modern accommodation infrastructure, shopping malls, innovation hubs and other such infrastructure meant to inspire students to work hard. @thamamoe
