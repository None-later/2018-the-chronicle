Lungani Mkwebu Showbiz Correspondent LUNGANI Mkwebu, a Bulawayo-born male model who participated at the South African Menswear Week autumn/winter collection 2018 (SAMW), is grateful for that opportunity which he says has opened many doors for him. Mkwebu who paraded Ara Kani, Kidd Huntaand, Nigeria’s Tokyo James and Maxivive’s designs at the SAMW, caught the eye of Vogue fashion photographers during the show and as a result, was featured on last month’s edition of the Vogue Italia fashion magazine. Lungani, who was born in 1991, is a qualified Architect from the Bulawayo Polytechnic and a product of Amanda Mutangadura’s AM Model Management Company. The feature on Vogue Italia will likely open doors for him like Nyasha Matonhodze who is featured on Louis Vuitton campaigns and Tholakele Dlamini who works with top designers such as David Tlale. “The highlight of my South African Menswear Week experience was appearing on the SABC3’s Expresso Breakfast Show and Vogue Italia. This is not only widening my horizon, but has introduced my brand to an international platform,” said Lungani. The former Mtshabezi High pupil has been modelling professionally for five years and has featured at top fashion shows such as the Durban Fashion Fair, Intwasa Fashion Show, Filipino’s John Ablaza show, Hifa and Matabeleland Fashion Week. Lungani said he learnt a lot from his sojourn in South Africa. “I’m still awed by the experience. Not only did I grow my portfolio, but meeting models, designers, organisers from different countries, ethnicities and seeing them work together creating an amazing show was truly a blessing and being part of it was the epitome,” said Lungani. He revealed that over six designers have since booked him for future stints on the runway.
