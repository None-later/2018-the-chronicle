Rodrick Mutuma Lovemore Zigara in Gweru FORMER Dynamos, Highlanders and Yadah striker, Rodrick Mutuma, is close to sealing a deal with Zifa Central Soccer League (CSL) debutants Sheasham FC. Mutuma is club hunting after his deal with Yadah was not renewed and indications are that he could be heading to Gweru in a bid to resurrect his career. Sheasham chairman, Malvern Paradza, said the Mutuma deal should be finalised soon and also confirmed that former Dynamos striker Patrick Khumbula and Tinei Chitora, who were released on a season’s loan by Chapungu, were also joining the CSL’s new kids on the block. “I can confirm that Roddy (Mutuma) has expressed interest in joining us and what is left is for him to come and put pen to paper. “We have agreed all terms and if all goes well, we will be unveiling him on Monday (today),” said Paradza. “We are pleased to also announce that our neighbours, Chapungu have loaned us Chitora and Khumbula on a season’s loan and we are confident that the two players will help the club achieve its goals this coming season. “As a club, we are indebted to Chapungu for showing good neighbourliness,” he said. Chapungu public relations manager, Tawanda Zowa, confirmed the departure of Chitora and Khumbula as well as Blessing Zabula, who has been loaned to sister club Blue Swallows, while Nhlanhla Ncube could be on his way to CSL campaigners Tongogara. Sheasham have so far captured the signatures of former Dynamos and Triangle midfielder Stephen Alimenda, the ex-Shabanie Mine duo of Victor Twaliki and Michael Mageja and former Caps United skipper, Edmore Chafungamoyo. The club has set itself a top four finish in its debut CSL season. @lavuzigara1
