 Yemurai Ushamba,Chronicle Reporter A “BEN 10” from Bulawayo has demanded paternity tests for two minor children he sired with his ex-girlfriend. This emerged on Thursday when Angeline Mhlanga (30) dragged Ian Munjanja (23) to the Maintenance Court for child support. Mhlanga was demanding $100 for the upkeep of two minor children aged two years and another aged two months. “We separated in April this year and since then he is not supporting the children. I am a hair dresser and I realise about $20 a month. He is employed by Eagleton Pump and Steel Supplies and he earns $279 a month. I am requesting $100 for the upkeep of my children,” she said. Munjanja offered $40. “Your worship, she is 30-years-old and I am 23. I am not sure the children are mine because of the age difference. I am requesting for DNA tests for both of the children. I earn $260 a month. I am offering $40 for the upkeep of the children,” he said. Bulawayo magistrate Miss Rachel Mukanga ordered Munjanja to pay $70 a month for the upkeep of his two minor children. She also ordered both parties to go for paternity tests within the next six months. “You are ordered to pay interim maintenance of $70 a month until paternity tests prove otherwise. Failure to go for tests within the next six months the order becomes a standing order,” she said. — @YUshamba
