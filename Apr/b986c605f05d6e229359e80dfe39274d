Chiefs coach Thulani Sibanda Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter PREMIERSHIP newcomers, Bulawayo Chiefs, face a stern test of character when they host Castle Lager Premier Soccer League champions, FC Platinum, at Luveve Stadium tomorrow. Chiefs head into tomorrow’s encounter smarting from two consecutive away defeats. They lost 0-2 to Harare City in the capital a fortnight ago and fell 0-1 to fellow new boys Mutare City Rovers at Vengere Stadium in Rusape. The two defeats have left Chiefs two places above the drop zone in 13th place with six points, just a point above Chapungu, who occupy the last relegation slot. Facing champions won’t be easy for the newcomers, but their capability to raise their game, as witnessed when they held Caps United to a 2-2 draw at Luveve Stadium speaks volumes of their capabilities. Chiefs were unlucky to lose both their games against Harare City and Mutare City Rovers, as they created lots of scoring opportunities, but failed to convert. Chiefs’ analyst and fitness trainer, Thulani Sibanda, is bullish ahead of the FC Platinum game, saying the zeal shown by his players in their recent games and at training can spring them to victory. “In terms of match fitness, I believe we are above 90 percent and what is left is for the players to convert chances that come our way. The defeats (against Harare City and Mutare City Rovers) are not a reflection of how we play; we do create scoring opportunities, but being wasteful is our biggest let down,” said Sibanda. “However, that can change any moment because the players are giving their all at training and who knows, it may be on Saturday against FC Platinum. We know they are the defending champions and psychologically pressure is on them, which means as underdogs we can play our game with ease.” He declined to share their game plan, but if they approach the match with the same attitude they displayed against Caps United, they could upset the applecart. Chiefs have quality players when going forward and their ability to quickly get behind the ball after losing possession is admirable. They are also good on the counter. The offensive players that FC Platinum should not underrate include attacking midfielders, Perfect Chikwende and Arthur Musiiwa, speedster striker Farawu Matare and skipper Kundishora Chakanyuka. Experienced utility player Moses Majika, who plays on the left side, is equally capable of causing damage to FC Platinum. Chiefs’ central midfield has been boosted by the registration of unheralded former Chicken Inn midfielder Brighton Backa Manhire, who had a two-year stint with South African National First Division side, Mbombela United. Manhire, the industrious Tatenda Muzuva and Gracious Muleya are all competing for the two central midfield positions, with Malvin Mkolo, Shadreck Nyahwa, Polite Moyo and Last Sithole marshalling their defence and Kelvin Nyoni guarding goal. On the other hand, Chiefs have to be wary of FC Platinum, who top the table with 16 points and are unbeaten in six outings. On paper, FC Platinum have arguably the best side any Premiership coach may wish for. They have the goalkeeping trio of Francis Tizayi, Petros Mhari and Wallace Magalane, defenders Kevin Moyo, Gift Bello and Elvis Moyo as well as Winston Mhango, Ali Sadiki, Kelvin Madzongwe, Rodwell Chinyengetere and Gift Mbweti in midfield. Former Highlanders, Chicken Inn and Bulawayo City striker Mkhokheli gives FC Platinum’s strike force the drive they need.
