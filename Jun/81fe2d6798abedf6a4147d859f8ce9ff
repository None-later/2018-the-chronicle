Joey Antipas Tadious Manyepo, Harare Bureau Black Rhinos 2-1 Chicken Inn IN-FORM Black Rhinos striker Vincent Mhandu scored one and engineered the other as he inspired the army side to a deserved victory over inconsistent Chicken Inn in a Castle Lager Premiership contest at the National Sports Stadium yesterday. Wellington Taderera scored the other goal for the hosts after a blunder by goalkeeper Pride Zendera while Moses Jackson grabbed a consolation for the visitors. Rhinos coach Herbert Maruwa was a happy man but warned his charges against getting carried away. “It’s a good sign that we are getting there. We are having a good run but we should keep working hard. We are in the league not to make numbers but to challenge any opponent. It’s good that we have managed to beat one of the serious title contenders and actually one of the favourites,’’ he said. Chicken Inn coach Joey Antipas, whose team suffered a second defeat on the trot, slammed his charges. “We are blowing hot and cold,” said Antipas. “The players need to step up their act. We did not fight. Football is all about fighting but there was no fighting in the team today. That happens in football but I need to read the riot act because players should play the game. Our attitude to the game was not up to scratch and we also applied ourselves badly.’’ Teams Black Rhinos: A Rayners, M Mambare (A Mbara 86th min) F Banda, B Homora, S Jimu, D Mudadi, W Kapinda, T Jaravani, V Mhandu (E Chigiji 83rd min), W Taderera (N Padzarondora 83rd min) L Chiunga Chicken Inn: P Zendera, P Bernard, C Samakweri (O Tarumbwa 46th min) G Goddard, M Jackson, I Mucheneka (K Nasama 86th min), S Munawa, C Matawu, X Ndlovu,G Majika (D Nyandoro 65th min), O Chirinda
