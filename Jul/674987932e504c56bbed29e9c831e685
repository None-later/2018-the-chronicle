Joseph Muchechetere Sports Reporter AS the Sports and Recreation Commission continue their search for a substantive director-general, they have indicated they are hoping to have the interviews held this week with 37 applicants vying for the job. The Sports Commission advertised for the job last month, for the third time, having done so twice last year before they suspended the process. They have been operating under an acting director-general, Joseph Muchechetere, since the retirement of Charles Nhemachena in 2016. The Sports Com-mission’s chairman, Edward Siwela, last week said they were going to have the interviews this week. Yesterday he reiterated the same sentiments although he could not give a specific date. “I don’t have the dates as yet. I did say it will be this week, we are addressing our logistics, which is why we haven’t actually finalised on the dates. “There might be changes but we are still hoping that it will be this week,” said Siwela. The process seems to be dragging since the search began early last year and Siwela said there has been some changes.
