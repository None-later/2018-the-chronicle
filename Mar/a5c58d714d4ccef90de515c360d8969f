Tendai Ndoro Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter South African Football Association (Safa) has ordered Warriors’ striker and former Chicken Inn gunman, Tendai Ndoro, to stop playing for his Absa Premiership side Ajax Cape Town with immediate fact. In a judgment released yesterday, Safa arbitrator Nassir Cassim SC referred Ndoro’s matter to the world football governing body, Fifa arguing the PSL’s Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) does not have jurisdiction over the matter. “Orlando Pirates and Polokwane City had lodged a protest with the PSL arguing that Ajax Cape Town had contravened Fifa rules by fielding the player. The player played for Pirates before signing for a Saudi Arabia side Al Faisaly before returning to the PSL to join Ajax. Fifa rules prohibit a player to play for three different clubs in a single season,” said Safa in a statement released yesterday. Ndoro hasA played for Orlando Pirates, Saudi Arabian club Al Faisaly as well as Ajax Cape Town this season, contravening Fifa’s Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players. “In his ruling on Wednesday, 28 March 2018, Cassim SC referred the case to Fifa saying it was because the matter involved an overseas/international club. He also ruled that in the meantime, the player should stop playing for Ajax,” said Safa. Ajax Cape Town are reeling in the murky waters of relegation with 24 points from the same number of games and the order will be a huge blow in their fight for survival.
