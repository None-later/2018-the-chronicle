Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter ZAMBIAN officials will take charge of the Caf Champions League preliminary round first-leg clash between FC Platinum and Clube Desportivo de Agosto at the Estadio de Novembro in Luanda, Angola on Sunday. Caf appointed experienced referee Audrick Nkole to blow the whistle and he will be assisted by Oliver Mweene and Romeo Kasengele, with Derrick Kasokota as the fourth official. Swaziland’s Jabulani Langwenya will be the match commissioner. Hopes will be high that the Zambians will handle the match professionally and let the best team on the field carry the day instead of determining the winner through dubious calls that normally spoil games in African club competitions. This year’s Caf matches will see, for the first time, all expenses for the match officials being borne by the continental football governing body in a move introduced as part of eliminating match manipulation by referees. Pure Platinum Play wrapped up their preparations for Sunday’s encounter with a 0-0 display against Zambian side Nkana Red Devils last weekend. An early away goal against the Angolans will help settle their nerves and see them remaining on course to qualify for the group stage of the tournament. If they eliminate the Angolans, they will meet the winner between Bidvest Wits of South Africa or Pamplemousses of Mauritius for a place in the group stage of the tournament.
