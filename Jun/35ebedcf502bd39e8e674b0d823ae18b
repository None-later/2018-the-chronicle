 Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau THE trial of a 31-year-old Zimbabwean man who is believed to be the kingpin of a cross border vehicle theft syndicate, has been set for June 27 at the Musina Magistrate’s court. Frank Dube and two accomplices; Tsununu Ahmad Maphosa (31), and Mpho Dzwuguda (26), were arrested between January and March on two separate occasions by the neighbouring country’s serious organised crime busting unit, the Hawks. Hawks Limpopo spokesperson, Captain Matimba Maluleke said the gang allegedly stole a fleet of six new Ford Rangers at a car dealership in Palaborwa in December 2017. “Maphosa and Dzwuguda were arrested after they were found with one of the stolen vehicles in January and will jointly stand trial with Dube. “The alleged kingpin (Dube) was arrested on March 6 at the Westgate Magistrate’s Court, while attending the court on a different charge of theft of a motor vehicle,” he said. Capt Maluleke said five of the stolen vehicles were recovered at the Limpopo River near Beitbridge Border Post before they could be smuggled into Zimbabwe. He said Dube was also expected to appear before Masisi Magistrate’s Court to face charges of burglary at business premises and several counts of theft of motor vehicles. “Further investigations are in progress and we are still pursuing other members of the gang,” said Capt Maluleke. He said the Hawks had crafted a raft of strategies to reduce cases of cross border vehicle theft and smuggling. In the last six months Zimbabwean and South African security agents recovered over 30 stolen vehicles along the boundary line. The Chronicle is reliably informed that some cars would be destined for Tanzania and Malawi, while others find their way to the local market.
