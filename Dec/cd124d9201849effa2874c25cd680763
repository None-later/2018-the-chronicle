It’s important that we’re meeting to introspect, share ideas, look at our strengths and our weaknesses and come up with resolutions as well as plan for the next four years. “We had our primary elections where people were shaken a bit and this is the time to forget the past and strengthen the party as well as celebrate our victory in the harmonised elections,” she said. Cde Muchinguri said the party continues to have a clear message to the people to remain united as the country re-engages with the outside world in the drive to improve the country’s economy. “This forum is expected to address a number of issues, which include corruption, economic development, creating jobs for our youths and our women.
We’re introspecting. Where we’ve failed, we will correct and chart the way forward. “It’s critical for us to review and re-evaluate the wok that we’ve done as the ruling party. The people of Zimbabwe are expecting positive results from the party and we’re promising not to let them down,” she said. Cde Muchinguri said since the conference was being held during the agricultural season, the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement would give reports on where the country stands in regards to the sector. Meanwhile, delegates yesterday began trooping to the conference venue – Mzingwane High School – from the country’s 10 provinces, singing and chanting party slogans. Several party bigwigs and security teams were also at the venue winding up preparations ahead of the indaba’s official opening today. Exhibitors yesterday said they were anticipating brisk business while President Mnangagwa is expected to tour the exhibition stands today. Zanu-PF caps, straw hats, key holders, jerseys inscribed ED Pfee, among others, are available for sale at the conference. — @pamelashumba1.
