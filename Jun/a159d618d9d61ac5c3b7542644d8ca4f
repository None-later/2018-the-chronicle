Amanda Grace Showbiz Correspondent SOUTH African gospel singer Takie “Psalmist” Ndou, Takesure Ncube and AmandaGrace will headline Harvest House International Church’s (HHIC) first ever live DVD recording this Sunday at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair Hall 4. The DVD recording will also have the likes of Wenyasha, Carlos Jiri, Sipho ‘snowy’ Ncube, Brian Bangura, Nompumelelo Bhebhe and Pride Panashe among many others. HHIC music minister Sukoluhle Luphahla said the live DVD recording that starts at 2PM had been inspired by the Clash of the Choirs competition hosted annually by the church. Entrance has been pegged at $1. “We’ve been running the ‘Clash of Choirs’ competition since 2014 aimed at grooming and investing in music talent within the church. Because of this competition, the church has committed to record an album so that some of these songs can be shared with the world to bring ministry and transformation to many lives,” said Luphahla. She said the album will comprise 25 songs composed by the HHIC choirs over the years. “We expect to produce an album that will carry 25 songs in different languages. We strongly believe the album will sell in different markets.” “Most of the songs were selected from previous clash of choirs. A few were however, composed from scratch. This will be the first global Harvest House music DVD and CD that our producers are working on tirelessly to ensure a quality product.” Takesure, a product of the church, is known for his exploits on Joyous Celebration and his hit song Kuregerera in Advance while Ndou is the man behind the hit song Unandavha. Following in the footsteps of Takesure is AmandaGrace who launched her song Bhera Rorira last year at the HHIC conference. The famous Outfit Band will add to the flair of the event as they will be playing during the concert.
