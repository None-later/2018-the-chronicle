 Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent A 27-YEAR-OLD carpenter from Kwekwe died on the spot after he was struck by a bolt of lightning while doing construction work at a house in Redcliff over the weekend. Knowledge Ncube was roofing a client’s house when he was struck by lightning on Saturday. His relative, Mr Prince Vhiriri, confirmed the incident.“We are still to come to terms with the whole incident which took Ncube’s life,” said Mr Vhiriri. He said Ncube left home for Redcliff on Saturday morning where he was roofing a client’s house. “We received a call from one of his workmates to the effect that Knowledge had been killed in a lightning incident,” said Mr Vhiriri. He, however, said the family suspected foul play as there was no rain on the day. “There were no rains on the day. Some clouds only gathered in the sky but there wasn’t even a drizzle. The next thing we learn that a person was killed as a result of lightning, it’s shocking,” Mr Vhiriri said. Acting Midlands Police Spokesperson Assistant Inspector Ethel Mukwende said she was yet to receive a report on the incident.
