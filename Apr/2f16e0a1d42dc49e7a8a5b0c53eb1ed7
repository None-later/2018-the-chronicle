LovemoreZigara in Gweru FIFTY eight coaches completed the Zifa Level One Coaching and the Goalkeepers’ Coaching courses at Chaplin High School in Gweru yesterday. A total of 41 coaches took part in the goalkeepers’ coach training while 17 were taking part in the Zifa Level One course. The two courses were overseen by Highlanders goalkeepers’ coach Tembo Chuma while Oscar Mazhambe was in charge of the Zifa Level One course with veteran instructor Gibson Homela overseeing the whole exercise. Among some of the notable names who were part of the training were former Chapungu goalkeeper Innocent Chogugudza, former Warriors goalkeepers Johannes Tshuma, Ephraim Mazarura and Chenjerai Dube. Speaking at the official opening of the course, Zifa vice president Omega Sibanda said the football mother body would want to facilitate the training of more goalkeepers’ instructors. “At the moment we have Tembo and Richard Tswatswa as the only qualified instructors in the country and the only way we can grow our football is to get young coaches and get them trained abroad for the instructors’ course,” he said. He said the last goalkeepers’ coaching course was held in 2012 and promised that more courses of such nature are on the way which will be held on a regular basis. Turning to the Zifa Level one coaching participants, Sibanda said the Caf licences courses will be brought back soon after they are standardised with other qualifications from Europe. He said during the standardisation of qualifications some former players’ qualifications will be allowed to sit on the bench without some requisite papers in consultation with the Zifa technical committee. The official opening ceremony was attended by Zifa Central Region Soccer League chairman Stanley Chapeta, Zifa Midlands chairman Brian Chishanga and Zifa Referees’ Committee secretary Musa Ntonga among others. — @lavuzigara1
