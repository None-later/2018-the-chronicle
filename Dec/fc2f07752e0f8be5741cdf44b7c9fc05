SOUTHERN Region Division One League champions Hwange dominated the second tier’s 11 Soccer Stars of the Year finalists, providing three players, who are also in contention for the top gong at the awards ceremony set for Sunday in Bulawayo. The Premiership bound players, who were shortlisted for the regional awards are the league’s top marksman with 21 goals Gilbert Zulu, goalkeeper Tymon Mvula and attacking midfielder, Canaan Nkomo, who has revived his career at the coalminers after leaving Tsholotsho FC at the beginning of the season. The trio were influential in Hwange’s early Premiership return that saw the coal miners winning the championship with ease. Zulu, who has already bagged the top goal scorer accolade is tipped to get the top gong. “The players who excelled this season were voted for by the 16 clubs. We’re grateful to our sponsor Raj Modi and his company for his support. We value the partnership with Liquor Hub, as they have continued to support us despite the prevailing economic challenges. “As a new board, we want to run the league as professional as we can so that we give Liquor Hub and other potential partners the maximum mileage that they deserve,” said Thebe.
