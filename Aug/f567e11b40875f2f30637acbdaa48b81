President Mnangagwa Chronicle Reporter PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has said he will work to create opportunities for youths in the next five years to fulfil their potential. In a post on Facebook and Twitter yesterday to mark International Youth Day which falls on August 12 every year, the President, who emerged victorious in the July 30 presidential poll, said opportunities are on offer for youths. “I am confident about our future because I believe in the talent, creativity and potential of our youth. As government, it is our role to empower and support you through providing diverse educational and employment opportunities. We must open the doors for you to fulfil your vast potential, and over the next five years, that is exactly what we will do. Let us always remember that it is by empowering the youth that our new Zimbabwe will be built. Happy International Youth Day!” wrote the President. Last month, the President said if he wins the presidential poll, 25 percent of his ministers will be youths as they are the country’s future. He said young people have a role to play in shaping the country’s development agenda hence the need to include them in senior Government positions. “The youth are the future. I will include the youth in my Cabinet and at least a quarter of my Cabinet will be young because the future belongs to the youth,” said President Mnangagwa. Since coming to power in November last year, the President has set a reformist agenda, opening up the political space and creating business opportunities. Cde Mnangagwa has previously said his administration will reward talent and innovation in its drive to transform Zimbabwe into a middle income status by 2030.
