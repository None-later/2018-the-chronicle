Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter CAF have named South African referee Christopher Harrison to take charge of the crucial second tie Total Caf Champions League preliminary round match between FC Platinum and Angola’s Desportivo de Agosto at Mandava Stadium on Wednesday. The 30-year-old Harrison was nicknamed “Mr Selfie” by some Cape Town City supporters after he was seen taking selfies with Mamelodi Sundowns players soon after the two teams’ match in Pretoria that saw him flashing four yellow cards to Cape Town City players. The “Kodak” moment incensed City coach Benny McCathy despite his boys chalking up a hard fought victory over the Brazilians. Having graduated into the Fifa referees’ list in 2016, Harrison will be assisted in the match by countrymen Athenkosi Ndongeni, who will be the first assistant referee, John Van Wyk Mervyn (second assistant) and fourth official Tinyiko Hlungwane. The match commissioner will be Mzee Zam Ali from Zanzibar. Pure Platinum Play go into the match needing to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit, which they suffered in Luanda last Sunday. With a huge support base from their passionate home town fans as well as patriotic Zimbabweans, FC Platinum have the pedigree to stun the Angolans and progress to the next round where they are likely to meet South African champions Bidvest Wits. Norman Mapeza, the FC Platinum gaffer, needs to ensure close attention is given to the Angolans’ Nigerian midfielder Ibukun, who gave his boys a torrid time at the Estadio 11 Novembre with defence-splitting passes and excellent ball control skills. Two-goal hero Jacques is a sniper, who also needs to be closely guarded by the home team’s rearguard consisting of the imposing Lawrence Mhlanga and Moyo twins Elvis and Kevin. @skhumoyo2000
