President Mnangagwa Editor: Nothing is impossible, our economy can improve if we are united and rally behind President Mnangagwa`s policies. He has promised to fight against corruption which is a major enemy of our economy. The new dispensation under President Mnangagwa is doing wonders to our economy, which was on the verge of collapsing. President Mnangagwa under his “open for business’’ mantra is creating new opportunities for Zimbabweans. In a short space of time roads were rehabilitated and the government is still in the process of rehabilitating more roads. The education sector is also being given more attention in this new dispensation as compared to the previous years. The Government is working on improving tertiary education. I would like to urge Zimbabweans to accept the election results and move forward. Let us all unite and rally behind the policies of the new dispensation. I feel that Zimbabwe is going to be great under this new dispensation. President Mnangagwa and his administration are doing very well and the changes they have made to Zimbabwe in a very short space of time are visible. Mutyavaviri, Harare  Good job done on typhoid fight The Government has done a great job by deploying a typhoid taskforce in Gweru and provided water treatment pills to every household in the city. But the Gweru City Council has a case to answer because they allegedly concealed the situation for about three weeks before August 6 when it decided to inform the Ministry of Health and Child Care about the water borne disease.
