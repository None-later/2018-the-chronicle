Peter Ndlovu Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter FOLLOWING their emotional promotion to the English third tier league this week, Coventry City’s longest serving African player and legendary former Zimbabwe international Peter Ndlovu has expressed a wish for his former club to return to the Premiership. Spotted at Highlanders as a dribbling wizard when he was an 18-year-old teenager, Ndlovu became only the second African player after another iconic former Highlanders’ player Bruce Grobbelaar to play in the English Premier League when he joined Coventry City in 1991. He stayed there until 1997 and left The Sky Blues in the elite league before they were relegated to the second tier league in 2001. They stayed there for 11 gruelling years and slipped further down to League One in 2012. In 2017, they dropped to the fourth tier League Two. Ndlovu took to Twitter to express his wish. “How will @Coventry_City do in the league above next season then? I hope one day they are back in the @premierleague!” wrote Ndlovu, now team manager at Absa Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns in South Africa. There were immediate responses from Coventry City fans, who also expressed optimism that their team should be in the Premier League soon. “You never know. Might win it,” replied Paul Woods. “Hi Peter. I really think we’ll do well next season. We have a good bunch of players and with a couple of additions, we should be up there,” wrote another blogger Adrian Jackson. Stuart Johnson wished Ndlovu could return to the club. “Peter, they have the nucleus of a good squad. Would love to see you at The Ricoh!!” he wrote. “If age was something that could be rewound, our hero Peter Ndlovu would be dazzling Premier League defences like they don’t exist. Cheers to our longest serving African player in the Barclays Premier League,” was another response from one Carmy.
