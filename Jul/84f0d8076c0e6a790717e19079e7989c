Langalakhe Mabena SKITTLE Inn Bar in the Bulawayo CBD recently underwent an extensive refurbishment which covered the structural integrity of the lodge as well as some additions. The refurbishment restored the nightspot back to its glorious best with a bar being added. The ballroom has been revamped while the rest of the place has been given a makeover. Tapiwa Gandiwa, the proprietor of the spot situated at Corner Herbert Chitepo and 14th Avenue said the idea was to make the venue more attractive. He said they wanted to meet the standards of other Bulawayo nightspots and also make the place comfortable for customers to drink and socialise. “Our new look is modern. It’s now a great place for imbibers to socialise. Not only have we changed the look, but we’ve also changed our offerings of drinks and bar snacks. “We’re delighted with the refurbishment results and look forward to welcoming imbibers into our beautiful new bar,” said Gandiwa.
