Madlela Skhobokhobo Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent AFTER his Madlela Day concert was washed out last year due to a heavy downpour in Gwanda, rhumba musician Madlela Skhobokhobo has decided to reschedule the event at the same venue at the end of this month. Taking place on March 31 at Phelandaba Stadium, the Madlela Day will feature performances by Jeys Marabini, Clement Magwaza, Hwabaraty, Gazi Elimnyama, Bhamuza, Zhezhingtons, Zinja Ziyamluma and Khuxxman. Entrance has been pegged at $3 with Madlela, of the Ngamnanka usaMamoe fame, saying he wants the event – meant to celebrate his successful career with people from his hometown – to be memorable. “Preparations for the show are at an advance stage. I was in Gwanda recently mobilising people. After the cancellation of the initial show in December last year, I promised them that I’d do a makeup show and I’m glad that I’m fulfilling that,” said Madlela. He said the show was to thank the people of Gwanda for the support they gave him last year and a celebration of his Skyz Metro FM and Bulawayo Arts Award accolades. “2017 was a great year for me and it was all because of my fans. Since I was born in Gwanda, people from that area supported me a lot and I want to thank them for that through this concert. “This is my small way to say thank you.” The line-up, Madlela said was a mixture of renowned artistes, experienced performers and talented Gwanda musicians. “The artistes that we’ve selected have been in the game for a long time such as Jeys Marabini, Khuxxman and Clement Magwaza with Zhezhingtons who are young and very talented artistes from Gwanda.” Advance tickets are set to go on sale in the coming week.
