President Mnangagwa is congratulated by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and the Chairperson of the African Union President Paul Kagame at National Sports Stadium in Harare yesterday Editor — Let me take this opportunity to congratulate President Mnangagwa for winning the just ended elections. The court has declared him the President and he had been inaugurated. Also I want to congratulate ZANU-PF, for the victory. What we need now is a people who understand what it takes to build unity and a nation. A people who value what we stand for as a country. But over and above a people who respect where we are coming from. From the moment we realise that the name Zimbabwe brings us together am sure we can be able to live in harmony as one. Despite political affiliations let’s work together to build a better Zimbabwe. To ZANU-PF as a party, we have entrusted you to lead us knowing that you are very capable. Let the journey begin. With our support, together we will boost this economy once again. To the opposition parties, in every competition there is one winner no matter how good you can all be. Let’s keep that in mind and accept defeat, but mostly learn because there will always be other competitions. To the people of Zimbabwe, let’s celebrate together. Queen Chuma, Harare.
