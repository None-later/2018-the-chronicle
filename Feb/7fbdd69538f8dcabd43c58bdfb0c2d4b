Moses Mutipforo Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter FORTY people have registered for the first edition of the two-day Bulawayo Chess Association (BCA)’s arbitration and coaching workshop that starts in the city today. The workshop, which is targeting mostly teachers, is meant to prepare participants for an international certification by the World Chess Federation (Fide). Fide arbiters Moses Mutipforo of Bulawayo and Kwekwe’s Wilfred Sithole are the course facilitators. “This is the first ever BCA Training, which is in line with our schools’ programme. The main objective is to equip chess trainers with skills in arbitration and coaching. BCA has been running many tournaments and we have noticed a big deficit with chess officiating and coaching and we want to arrest that. This is the first of many trainings, which we will be rolling out over the next five years. In that period, we hope to have at least 20 Fide certified arbiters in Bulawayo,” said BCA chairman Elvis Shora. Bulawayo has two Fide certified arbiters, Mutipforo and Thabang Moyo as well as Fide trainer Melzedeck Masimba. Shora said they were impressed with the number of participants that signed up for the course. “Schools are a key area in terms of chess development and as such, we’ve had 40 participants registering for the workshop. Most of these are teachers, who will go back to their schools to apply the right skills to pupils at the grassroots. We will continue holding such workshops so that we keep these people abreast of the required international standards in our endeavour to develop and create interest in chess at the grassroots level,” Shora said. @ZililoR
