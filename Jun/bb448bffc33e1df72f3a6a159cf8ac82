 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Boxing Federation (ZBF) will hold a training course for referees and judges in Bulawayo set to run for four weekends starting today at the Khumalo Hockey Stadium. The course is targeting new referees and judges who will officiate at club and provincial boxing championships. “The course will run for four consecutive weekends. We have been given a great opportunity as Bulawayo to have such an event. In the past we have had Harare referees coming to officiate in the tournaments that we have here. It will be great to have qualified referees and judges in the city that will help in improving the sport by providing quality officiating. We are calling on everyone interested to become a professional judge or referee to come and join us,” said Philip Striker Ndlovu, a ZBF facilitator. “On completion, the participants will be able to officiate at club and provincial level. This is the first level of the official course and we hope that those who will succeed will go on and acquire higher qualifications,” he said. Registration fees for the course have been pegged at $20. Ndlovu said Zimbabwe has potential to become a powerhouse in the continent and having such courses was a step in the right direction as they aim to unlock the vast potential that the country possesses. “We are encouraging more women to come and take part in these courses because as a boxing federation we are conscious of the need to integrate women into the sport,” said Ndlovu.
