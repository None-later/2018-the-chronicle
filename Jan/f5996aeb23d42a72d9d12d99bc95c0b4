In an interview on arrival at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport yesterday, Mr Gumede said he was optimistic about investing in the country under the new political dispensation owing to the conducive policies pitched by President Mnangagwa. “I am happy to be here in Zimbabwe just to see what one can do in assisting the Government in achieving its short-term goals of turning around the economy. As an entrepreneur and businessman who is involved in various  businesses, I felt it was an opportune time to come into your country and identify some of the opportunities that my company will be able to invest in,” he said. Mr Gumede who said he was already an investor in the country in the tourism sector, said he wanted to invest more, especially in infrastructure and ICT. “For me Zimbabwe offers a great opportunity and Zimbabwe used to be the bread basket of Africa. I believe good times are back and I didn’t want to wait, especially when I am in South Africa as a neighbour,” said Mr Gumede. He said if Zimbabwe and South Africa combined their strengths, they could do so much together and that Africans should help each other. “I want to partner with local Zimbabweans in various sectors of the economy where we will work together. What will stop Zimbabweans from investing in South Africa? Nothing!” he said. He said Zimbabwe had the most intelligent and hardworking people. Guma Group business development executive Mr Emmanuel Charumbira said they were looking at investing more than $1,2 billion in the country. “Guma is not new to Zimbabwe. We have investments in Victoria Falls where we have two lodges and we are also operating helicopters in Victoria Falls. “At the moment, looking at the projects we have targeted based on our research, we are looking in the region of $1,2 billion to invest in the country,” he said. Local company, Brookes Enterprises chairman Mr Samson Paul said he initiated the investment deals that saw Mr Gumede coming to Zimbabwe. “It is the responsibility of every patriotic Zimbabwean to do whatever they can in their respective fields to help revive the economy,” he said. President Mnangagwa visited South Africa in December where he addressed an oversubscribed business indaba.He assured South Africans and the Zimbabwe diaspora of immense business opportunities in the country and that Zimbabwe was open for investment.
