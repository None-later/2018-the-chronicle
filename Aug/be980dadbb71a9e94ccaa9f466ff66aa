 Three convicted paedophiles have been shot then hanged in a public square in Yemen after raping and killing a 10-year-old boy. The men had tortured the child before choking him and hiding his body in an abandoned home, according to reports in the Middle East. Abdul Jalil al-Ashhab (19) Mohammed Said al-’Uqri (27) and Ghaleb al-Rashdi, also 19, were all executed by a firing squad yesterday. Their bodies were then hanged in the city of Sana’a. Shocking pictures show the corpses of the men, wearing blue overalls, on display in the heart of the city, which is the biggest in Yemen. They had been shot five times in the heart, it is reported. Their bodies were hanged from a crane as a warning to others who planned to commit similar crimes. The men had committed the killing last October, Sputnik reports. The young boy was abducted while heading to his grandmother’s house, then handcuffed and attacked in a nearby school. His corpse was found four days later. — AP
