 Lovemore Kadzura, in Rusape Mutare City  0 – 2 Nichrut SELF-PROCLAIMED prince of Zimbabwean football Roderick Mutuma was the hero yesterday when he scored a brace on his return to Premiership football to hep newsboys Nichrut dispatch host Mutare City Rovers in a dull match at Vengere yesterday. Nichrut fielded two former City Rovers players in veteran defender Temba Ndlovu and experienced striker Washington Pakamisa who ditched the amateurish run municipal side during the mid season break. The lanky Mutuma slotted home his first goal in the 32nd minute after capitalising from poor defending from Rovers who were clearly missing the services of Ndlovu to marshal the backline. There was nothing much to write home in the first half as both sides failed to play meaningful football resorting to pumping the ball upfront much to the chagrin  of the few paying fans who braved the chilly weather to watch the match. In the second half Mutare City came charged up but could not breach the Nichrut defence commandeered by Ndlovu. Even Evans Chikwayikwayi’s trademark long throw ins did little to shake Nichrut defence. In the 68th Mutuma proved that nothing beats experience when he outwitted ball watching Rovers defenders to connect a cross and tapped it past City goalkeeper Alfred Chiname who could only gaze as the ball hit the back of the net. “What do you expect from a team that has not been training for the past three weeks? Our opponents Nichrut have been training all along.  That is the situation I have. I am not the one to comment on salaries issue, said  Mutare City stand in coach Ndega Matsika. “I am happy with the three points we collected today. The boys played well and according to instructions. Yes experience also played a part we have experienced and seasoned PSL players in our squad. We are now preparing for our next match against Chicken Inn,” said Nichrut coach John Nyikadzino.
