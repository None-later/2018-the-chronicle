Norman Matemera Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter A FEW days after lifting the lid on an attempt to bribe them to influence the outcome of a Caf Confederation Cup game, referee Norman Matemera and his assistants Salani Ncube and Brighton Nyika have received another direct appointment from Caf. The trio and Nomore Musundire will take charge of the Total Caf Confederation Cup encounter between Asec Mimosa of Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana’s Aduana FC in Abidjan on May 6. Matemera raised the red flag after an attempt by Equatorial Guinea outfit Desportivo Niefang to pay him a $10 000 bribe to ensure the Equatorial Guinea side registers a decisive win through his influence in the Caf Confederation Cup play-off tie against Cote d’Ivoire’s Williamsville Athletic Club on Wednesday last week. Desportivo Niefang won 2-1, but still bowed out 3-2 on aggregate after falling 2-0 in the first-leg in Cote d’Ivoire. But there was drama on the eve of the match as Desportivo Niefang officials, working in cahoots with Togolose match commissioner Lawson Mahuwe as their emissary, tried to offer Matemera and his assistants Nyika, Ncube and Musundire $10 000 to ensure the Equatorial Guinea side won the match to advance to the group stages of the competition. Matemera, however, resisted those attempts and reported the incident to Caf. Zimbabwe Referees Committee vice-chairman Gladmore Muzambi will also be on international duty as a match commissioner in a Total Caf Confederation Cup match between Uniao Desportiva do Songo of Mozambique and Renaissance Sportive de Berkane of Morocco. The match will be played on May 16. Burundian Pacifique Ndabihawenimana will be the centre man in the encounter, with Sudan’s Mohammed Abdallar Ibrahim as the first assistant and Herve Kakunze also from Burundi the second assistant. Mahmood Ali Ismail from Sudan will be the fourth official while the general coordinator of the encounter will be Helly Zafinimanga.
