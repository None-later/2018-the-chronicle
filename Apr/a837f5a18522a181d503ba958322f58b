 Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Gwanda Correspondent TWO burglars broke into a Gain Cash and Carry Wholesale branch in Gwanda and got away with more than  $10 000 after tampering with a safe. The burglars who are on the run allegedly gained access into the premises undetected by a security guard who was manning the place. Gain Cash and Carry Wholesale regional operations manager, Ms Lydia Chibvuri said the incident occurred on Tuesday around 2AM. She said they were yet to establish how the burglars gained entry into the premises. She said the offence was discovered by workers when they arrived for work. “Burglars broke into our branch in Gwanda and they stole  more than $10 000 which was secured in a safe that was in one of the offices. They broke the lock to the safe to access the money. We are not yet sure how they managed to gain entry into the premises as the doors were still secured and there was no sign of a forced entry. “We went over the CCTV footage and in it we saw two masked men who were wearing gloves, in the shop around 2AM. We are still in the process of analysing the footage and to establish whether or not they took  goods besides the cash,” she said. Ms Chibvuri said they reported the matter to the police who attended the scene and were still carrying out investigations. She said the money which was stolen was for sales which were made the previous day. Ms Chibvuri said the money was set to be banked on Tuesday. “The money which was stolen was for transactions carried out on Monday and because we close late we were set to bank it on Tuesday. When contacted for comment Matabeleland South provincial police spokesperson, Inspector Philisani Ndebele said he was yet to receive a report on the incident. @DubeMatutu
