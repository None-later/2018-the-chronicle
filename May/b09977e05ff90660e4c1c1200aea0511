Darlington Dodo Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BELEAGUERED Bulawayo City FC coach Darlington Dodo seems to have taken charge of his last match when the municipal side fell 1-2 to struggling Dynamos in Harare on Sunday. City are languishing second from the bottom of the Castle Lager Premier League table with four points off eight games and Dodo will not be in the dugout when they take on Nichrut at Barbourfields Stadium tomorrow. Instead, national Under-20 coach Bekithemba Ndlovu will be in charge of the team in a caretaker role. According to City officials, Dodo, who failed to save Tsholotsho from relegation last season, was given a target of 34 points for the first half of the season, which is now impossible for the side to reach. The loss to Dynamos means City can only reach the halfway mark with 31 points, but only if they win all their remaining nine games. City chairman Jerry Sibanda yesterday said a decision will be announced tomorrow. “The coach (Dodo) wasn’t around today so we can only have something concrete on Wednesday. There were targets that were to be met and we couldn’t review the performance of the team in his absence since he is in Harare. We’re directing all our energy towards our home game against Nichrut at Barbourfields Stadium on Wednesday. It’s likely that the assistant coach Ndlovu will lead the team on Wednesday while we review the team’s performance with the coach (Dodo),” said Sibanda. With a limited number of local coaches with Caf A badges, City might settle for former Highlanders coach Amini Soma-Phiri, who is presently unattached. Dodo embarked on a massive overhaul of the squad at the beginning of the year, retaining just a third of the squad that did duty in 2017. He retained young goalkeeper Aaron Ngwenya, the defensive trio of captain Zibusiso Sibanda, Zephaniah Ngodzo and Morris Kadzola, midfielders Rainsome Pavari, Humphrey Ncube, Trevor Ndlovu, Innocent Kutsanzira, Sipho Ndlovu and Clive Rupiya. @ZililoR
