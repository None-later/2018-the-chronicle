Minister Winston Chitando Lovemore Zigara, Midlands Correspondent GOVERNMENT has engaged two foreign firms to evaluate dumps at Shabanie Mashava Mines (SMM) as part of efforts to extract asbestos fibre and other minerals. Early this year SMM invited expressions of interest, looking for a partner to extract and process minerals from its asbestos tailing dumps. SMM has 49 tailing dumps located at its mines, which contain magnesium, chrome, nickel, platinum group metals, copper and gold. Mines and Mining Development Minister, Winston Chitando, said proceeds from the venture will be used to recapitalise the mine. “As we speak we have two entities, one which is a Canadian-based company and another one using Germany technology, which are analysing these dumps,” he said. “The objective is to extract the asbestos, which could have gone into the dumps but secondly extracting those minerals, which were not being exploited as the mine was open for these years. The revenues, which will be very significant, will be used to recapitalise Shabanie Mine,” added Minister Chitando. He said Government expects to have the full report by July, which will culminate in the plant design and fundraising for the purchase of the machinery to be used in the extraction of the minerals. The evaluation of the tailing dumps has been carried out by at least four different teams of consultants in the past, but this work never proceeded to the pilot plant phase. As part of its recapitalisation drive, the asbestos miner is also seeking to dispose some of its assets to raise $196 million capital to resume operations. Some of the assets earmarked for disposal include chrome, gold, nickel, lime and tantalite claims mostly along the Great Dyke, as well as houses in both Zvishavane and Mashava. @lavuzigara1
