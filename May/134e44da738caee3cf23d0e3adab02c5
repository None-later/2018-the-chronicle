Tendai Chikuni Lovemore Zigara in Gweru SHABANIE Mine have dismissed speculation that they intend rehiring former coach Tendai Chikuni to replace Takesure Chiragwi. The asbestos miners are second from bottom on the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League table with a paltry nine points, which has triggered calls for Chiragwi’s sacking. Shabanie supporters recently denounced Chiragwi and called for the reinstatement of Chikuni, who is currently club hunting after severing ties with Chapungu. Chikuni is revered at the asbestos miners, having guided the Chinda Boys back into the topflight league in 2016. Shabanie Mine secretary Max Nyashanu said the club is not hiring Chikuni, but working to address problems in its camp to turn around its waning fortunes. “Those are rumours which are being peddled by people who do not know what is going on at the club. We have not been in touch with Chikuni and no negotiations are taking place and if there are to be any developments at the club, we will use the proper channels to communicate,” said Nyashanu. “We appreciate that we are in a tight spot as a club where we are second from bottom and obviously any team does not want to be in that sort of position and we are doing everything as an executive to get out of the drop zone.” He, however, could not be drawn into commenting on what the club will do in light of the poor results, saying “an announcement will be made in due course”. Sources at the club said a technical shake up is looming at Shabanie Mine which might claim the scalp of Chiragwi. The sources said Chikuni’s name had been thrown around to replace Chiragwi as he understands the culture of the club. — @lavuzigara1
