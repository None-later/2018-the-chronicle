Khama Billiat FORMER Qarabag striker Dino Ndlovu says Khama Billiat must be committed to his football in order to make it in Azerbaijan. The Zimbabwean international looks to be on his way out of Chloorkop, with Azerbaijani outfit Qarabag reportedly courting his signature. Ndlovu had a spell with the club from 2016 to 2017 before moving to Hangzhou Greentown in the Chinese second division. “My advice (to Billiat) is that he needs to be 1 000 percent committed to the cause if he moves to Qarabag because the coach (Gurban Gurbanov) there doesn’t take prisoners, he is like a dictator,” Ndlovu tells KickOff.com. “He doesn’t like players who enjoy night life, players who go out to night clubs. He knows everything about the city, he controls everything. He will tell you at a certain time you must be home or else you will be fined. The following day he will ask you: ‘where were you last night and what time did you get home?’ and when he does that it is because he already knows the answer. “He wants his players to be committed to football. He wants his players to drink, eat and sleep football, nothing else. If it’s true that Billiat is going to Qarabag, he needs to think football and nothing else. His life must be football and other things must come second.” — KickOff.
