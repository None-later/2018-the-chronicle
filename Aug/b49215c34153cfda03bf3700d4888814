Lisa Mangena and Michelle Gwizi, Chronicle Reporters A BULAWAYO family is appealing for food, clothing and assistance to rebuild its home after property worth thousands of dollars was reduced to ashes when a house caught fire in Bulawayo’s Makokoba suburb. The fire was triggered by paraffin that had leaked from a stove. After realising that her stove had caught fire, a tenant tried to throw it away and paraffin which was spilling resulted in a fire engulfing her room, before spreading to others. The fire burnt everything in the house but people managed to escape. A family member Mrs Thenjiwe Chizhande said they were appealing for help as they had lost everything including clothes following the fire last week. The family lives with three others who are tenants. “We lost everything and we don’t know how we will recover all that was destroyed,” she said. Those who may want to assist the families can contact the owner of the house, Mr Jaison Magutshwa, on 0713565011. Mr Thulani Magutshwa, son to the owner of the house, said he heard a knock on his window and ignored it thinking it was one of his drinking mates. After inhaling some smoke, he opened his door to check where it was coming from. “After I inhaled smoke I rushed to check the cause only to find the house burning,” said Thulani. In an interview, the senior divisional officer of the Bulawayo fire and ambulance services, Mr Edward Mpofu said the family tried to contact them but failed to get through. “The family tried to call the station but there was no electricity thus failing to get through. One of the relatives later reached a fire fighter in Pumula who alerted people at the station,” said Mr Mpofu. He said when they went to the house it was late and some property had been destroyed. @LissahMangena_ @gwizi_n
