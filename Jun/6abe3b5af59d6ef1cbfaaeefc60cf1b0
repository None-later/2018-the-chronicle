 Walter Mswazie in Masvingo THE National Social Security Authority (NSSA) has embarked on door-to-door business inspections in Masvingo province and Zvishavane district to ascertain the level of compliance by employers. Several companies stand accused of deducting pension arrears from workers’ salaries but fail to remit the monies to NSSA. In a notice the authority said the exercise followed the end of the amnesty on defaulting business, which had been extended from December 2017 to February 2018. “The National Social Security Authority (NSSA) compliance inspectors will be carrying out door-to-door business inspections from all employers within Masvingo Province including Zvishavane and Chiredzi Districts from June 11 to June 15, 2018,” reads the statement. “The exercise follows the amnesty that was extended to unregistered employers who have not been deducting contributions, which was valid from 01 December 2017 to 28 February 2018. “We are very pleased with the response from many companies that came forward to register.” The pensions’ body said all employers in arrears in terms of contributions and premiums should contact NSSA offices to arrange acceptable payment plans. “We urge all our employers to cooperate with our inspectors who are identified through production of a NSSA inspector’s identification card,” he said. @walterbmswazie2
