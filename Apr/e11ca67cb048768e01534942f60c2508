Dr Thokozani Khupe Pamela Shumba, Senior Reporter THE breakaway MDC-T led by Dr Thokozani Khupe today faces a moment of truth as it holds its congress to elect its substantive leaders after splitting from the group under Advocate Nelson Chamisa. The MDC-T officially split last month and Dr Khupe, national organising secretary Mr Abednego Bhebhe and national spokesperson Obert Gutu were fired from the party. Dr Khupe was locked in a succession battle with Advocate Chamisa to replace the party’s founding president  Mr Morgan Tsvangirai who died in February. The party’s national council endorsed Advocate Chamisa as Mr Tsvangirai’s successor but Dr Khupe refused to recognise him, arguing that she was the only elected MDC-T deputy president who was supposed to take over from Mr Tsvangirai. Dr Khupe’s camp’s has accused Advocate Chamisa and his supporters of violating the party’s constitution and engaging in violence. The two camps are fighting over the party name and symbols and their case is pending in the courts. Dr Khupe’s spokesperson Mr Witness Dube yesterday said all was set for the party’s special congress to be held at White City Stadium in Bulawayo today. “We’re finalising preparations for the congress and we’re well on course. We’re confident in everything that we’re doing. “We’re not worried about numbers because we started on a good note in terms of membership. We’re actually oversubscribed and we can’t even afford to transport all our members to the congress. We don’t need to compete for members,” said Mr Dube. He said the camp was in the process of accrediting its members who will attend the congress, with adequate security having been put in place. — @pamelashumba1
