Roy Mazingi Lovemore Zigara in Gweru CHAPUNGU have started preparations to stage the Roy Mazingi Memorial tournament in memory of their goalkeeper who passed away early this year. The tournament has been scheduled for March 3 at Ascot stadium where four teams, Premiership champions FC Platinum, Shabanie Mine, Nichrut and Chapungu have been invited to participate. The tournament is meant to raise funds for Mazingi’s family. “Waru Waru” public relations officer Tawanda Zowa said the tournament is set to honour Mazingi who was one of their finest goalkeepers in recent years. “We are going to hold the tournament in honour of Roy Mazingi and all proceeds realised from the tournament will be channelled towards his family. He is one of our best goalkeepers in recent years and died at a young age and as a club we feel it is our responsibility to contribute something towards his family,” said Zowa. “We had wanted the tournament to be held this weekend but as you know one of the participating teams FC Platinum is busy preparing for the CAF champions league so we have pushed the dates. We had also not given the tournament enough publicity hence the postponement,” he added. Zowa said in the event that one of the clubs fail to turn up for the tournament, they have put Zifa Central Soccer League Division One outfit Sheasham on standby. Mazingi, who was the Chapungu first choice goalkeeper, passed away at the age of 31 at Manyame Airbase Hospital after a short illness.— @lavuzigara1
