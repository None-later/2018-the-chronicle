 Lovemore Zigara in Gweru GWERU-based FC Lesaffre continued with their fine run by dispatching Vumbachikwe 2-1 in the Zimbabwe General Medical Aid Fund Central Soccer League encounter in Gwanda at the weekend. First half goals by Nicole Mutapiwa and Leo Hofisi secured maximum points for the yeast makers. The win made them joint leaders with Whawha on six points, although they have an inferior goal difference. Peter Manoti, the FC Lesaffre coach, said his target was at least 12 points in their first five games. “It’s a good start for us, especially managing to collect maximum points away from home. However, it is only the beginning and our objective is to maintain consistency and see where it takes us. If we can win four out of five of our opening games, it will be good enough for us,” Manoti said. Elsewhere, Whawha also maintained their 100 percent record with a 3-1 home win over FC Platinum Under 19. The Prisons and Correctional Services side scored through Albert Matewu’s brace and a strike by Liberty Dube. Whawha coach Luke Petros-Jukulile expressed satisfaction with his charges’ performances. “So far so good for us as a team. I am happy that we are scoring goals, which means we are converting our chances. It shows that we have improved as a team since this was our undoing last season and it cost us promotion,” said Petros-Jukulile. The highly anticipated clash pitting last year’s runners up Tongogara and the expensively assembled Sheasham failed to produce any goals at Mkoba Stadium. Both teams are yet to register a win of this season. Results Ivan Hoe 2 – 1 Black Eagles, ZPC Munyati 1 – 0 MSU, Vumbachikwe 1 – 2 FC Lesaffre, Whawha 3 – 1 FC Platinum U19, Telone 2 – 0 Blanket Mine, Sheasham 0 – 0 Tongogara. @lavuzigara1
