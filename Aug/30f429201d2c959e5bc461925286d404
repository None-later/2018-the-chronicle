 Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter TWO Zimbabwean photographers will exhibit their work at the 11th edition of the FNB Joburg Art Fair in South Africa next month. Charmaine Chitate and Davina Jogi both took astounding pictures during last year’s Operation Restore Legacy which led to the resignation of former president Robert Mugabe. This was a historic moment for Zimbabweans and the two photographers captured the great moments of Zimbabweans in jovial mood celebrating with the military personnel. Jogi is an award winning photojournalist from Harare, working between Zimbabwe and Australia. She focuses on documenting social justice issues and has a particular interest in stories of identity and migration. Jogi’s picture of a soldier carrying a baby during the operation in November last year caught the attention of many  and it is also nominated at the FNB  Joburg Art Fair amongst many other African artists. Chitate is a multimedia creative who is currently studying for a BA in Communication Science with UNISA. Chitate captured a stunning picture of a soldier on a tank greeting the masses in solidarity with the historic movement which was taking place. 50 artists were nominated across Africa and the 20 top artists who would  have received many votes shall be announced on the week of the Joburg Art Festival which shall take place from September 7 to 9 at the Sandton Convention Centre. There are also other Zimbabweans nominated at the Joburg Art Fair including a freelance photojournalist Antony Zinyange, Surrealist Troy Makaza, Takunda Regis Billiat, Sky Salanje, Helen Teede, Grace Cross and Jekesai Njikizana
