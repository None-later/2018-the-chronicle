RENOWNED writer, Philani Nyoni, says although he missed out on the 2018 African Writers’ Award, it was a step in the right direction for his career. Nyoni was the only Zimbabwean nominated among 10 nominees from Nigeria, Kenya, Malawi, Ghana and Zambia for his short story Celestial Incest. The award ceremony held recently in Nigeria saw Kenya’s Benson Mugo being awarded in the short story category for Dawn. Nyoni said he was not discouraged. “I lost and nonetheless, awards always have their controversy. Judging creativity is always a subjective endeavour but I won’t be disheartened. What’s important is the work and that one stays on track, hitting their quadrants and speaking their truth. Anything else after that is icing or noise,” said Nyoni. He said penning the short story made him fall in love again with prose. “What was important was that I stepped out of my comfort zone which was poetry. I was too comfortable as a writer. I started off writing prose before I became engrossed with writing poetry. “So going back to what I loved before was a great feeling and to top it all off, I was nominated for it.” The African Writers’ Award is annually hosted by the African Development Trust and the award is given to writers of African descent with stories that are unique, impactful and thought-provoking. In his career, Nyoni has bagged two National Art Merit Awards, namely the Outstanding First Creative Work in 2013 for Once A Lover Always A Fool and Outstanding Poet in 2016. Last year, he clinched a Bulawayo Arts Award for Outstanding Literary Work for Mars His Sword.
