 NAMIBIA lit up the opening day of the 2018 Cosafa Under-17 Championships with a stunning 8-3 victory over Seychelles in a Group A clash at the Stade St Francois Xavier in Port Louis, Mauritius, yesterday. Prins Tjiueza scored four goals and Tyrin George grabbed a hat-trick as the 2016 champions ran riot in the second period, having claimed a 4-3 halftime lead. In fact, Seychelles, who scored their goals through Afandi Aboudou, Jarrel Suzette and Rino Pauline, had levelled the game at 3-3 after 20 minutes in what was an action-packed opening to the tournament. But the islanders faded in the second period as Namibia continued to keep the pressure on and provided an early show of their potential to go all the way again in this year’s  competition. Hosts Mauritius, who were finalists last year, were left stunned following a 0-1 loss to Botswana in the other Group A match. The closely fought clash looked to be heading for a 0-0 draw before Oageng Maphorisa converted from the spot for the Young Zebras with eight minutes remaining. Mauritius defender Laurent Maison Rouge, who conceded the spot-kick, was also handed the first red card of the tournament. There was a single fixture in Group B where defending champions Zambia were held to a 0-0 draw by Mozambique. The action continues today with three matches, including a Group B opener for two-time champions South Africa against Lesotho. There will be two games in Group C, with Angola taking on Malawi. Zimbabwe have underachieved at Under-17 level given the rich source of talent in the country and they will get the chance to show their quality with an opener against Swaziland.
