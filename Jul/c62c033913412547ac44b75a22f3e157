 Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter ATTEMPTS by ZPC Hwange and Mosi Rovers to have Talen Vision and Tsholotsho sanctioned for using “new” players before the Zifa Southern Region Division One league reached the halfway mark have hit a brick wall. ZPC Hwange wrote to Zifa Southern Region on July 9 complaining about Talent Vision’s use of Heritein Masuku, who was acquired from ZRP Bulawayo and Brian Muza, who joined Vision from CIWU. ZPC Hwange secretary Mehluli Thebe quoted Fifa’s Article 6 registration periods which reads: “III. Registration of Players 2. The first registration period shall begin after the completion of the season and shall normally end before the new season starts. This period may not exceed twelve weeks. The second registration period shall normally occur in the middle of the season and may not exceed four weeks. The two registration periods for the season shall be communicated to Fifa at least 12 months before they come into force. “Fifa shall determine the dates for any association that fails to communicate them on time.” Thebe said: “Unless the region has got its own regulations that do not follow the above article, then communication to the clubs was supposed to be made prior. It is against this background that we feel the sporting integrity of the league was jeopardised.” ZPC Hwange’s complaint came after they were beaten 2-0 by Talen Vision on Match Day 14. Mosi Rovers’ protest also came after Match Day 14 played on the on the weekend of July 7 and 8. Rovers lost 2-0 at home to Tsholotsho and they complained about Welcome Ndiweni and MacDonald Farau, whom they had earlier played against when they were at NRZ Leopards. “Are players not supposed to move in the second leg of matches rather than playing for two clubs in the first rounds of the league? Your response and guidance will be welcome for we wish we could have also used our additional signings had we known it is acceptable. We tried reading Fifa Regulations on player status and transfer Article 6 clause 3 and decided to seek clarity,” wrote Mosi secretary Mduduzi Dlodlo. Zifa Southern Region board member Tumediso Mokoena-Ndlovu said there is nothing amiss about the four players, adding that they were registered when the mid-season transfer window opened. “There’s nothing sinister that has been done with regards to the players’ registrations. Every year the traditional mid-year transfer window opens from July 1 to 31. It is the national association that announces the opening or the dates for the mid-year transfers. Any player who is registered during this period is free to play,” said Ndlovu.
