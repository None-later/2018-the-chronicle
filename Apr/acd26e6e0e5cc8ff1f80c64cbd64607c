Kirsty Coventry Lovemore Zigara in Gweru SWIMMING icon Kirsty Coventry has hinted at rolling out her HEROES project to other parts of the country by the end of the year. HEROES is a Kirsty Coventry Academy community-based pro-gramme that was launched in 2017 to leverage the power of sport as an effective method for tackling community issues. It provides free swimming lessons to children in underprivileged areas of Zimbabwe. The programme is already running in Chitungwiza, Dzivarasekwa and Kambuzuma in Harare. The former Olympic champion said she hopes to rope in corporates to bankroll some of her projects. “At the moment we want to reach out to our corporates and try to secure some sponsorship for these programmes. We want to take on board as many kids as possible in this project. We want to make a positive impact in these communities and we hope to be outside of Harare and go national by the end of the year,” Coventry said. The project was mooted by Coventry and her husband Tyrone Seward when they toured Zimbabwe to “Inspire our Youth to become their own Heroes”. They also used this opportunity to determine what these communities needed and how they could use their successes and experiences in sport to benefit the children and their families. The programme utilises existing facilities, schools, sports centres, fields and volunteer coaches to create a safe and fun environment where children can participate in sport. @lavuzigara1
