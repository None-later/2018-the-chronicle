Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Gwanda Correspondent GWANDA Rural District Council is constructing seven schools and seven clinics as part of its 100-day programme. In an interview after a Rural District Development Committee meeting, Gwanda District Administrator, Mr Judge Dube, said they were also focusing on road maintenance. He said seven schools and seven clinics were under construction and the target was to have covered a lot of work during the 100 days. “In the district our main focus during the 100 days is infrastructure development. We are looking forward to carrying out road maintenance works where we will be grading roads. “We will also be focusing on construction of infrastructure namely schools and clinics. We have seven schools and clinics which are under construction within the district. Some of these projects are just starting while others are at an advanced stage. “During the 100 days, we plan to finish some of these projects or to cover as much ground as possible,” he said. Mr Dube said they had managed to secure funding for the projects, but they were still approaching more investors. He said the road network in the province was very bad while there was a need for more schools and clinics in order to reduce distances walked by community members to access services easily. “The district still has a huge deficit of schools and clinics. The road network throughout the district is in a poor state as some roads have surpassed their life span. Grading some of these roads is no longer helping and they need to be reconstructed from scratch. “That is why we decided to focus on these key areas during our 100 day plan because of the need which is there,” he said. The government has come up with a 100-day programme since President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s inauguration last November to bring new social and economic order in the country. @DubeMatutu
