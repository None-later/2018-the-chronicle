Lovemore Zigara in Gweru SHURUGWI based Premiership side Nichrut hopes to turn the tide when they face a fired up Triangle United in a Castle Lager Premiership encounter this afternoon at Ascot Stadium. Nichrut have had a restive week after the PSL slapped the club with a $4000 fine over crowd trouble following their 3-4 loss to Caps United earlier this season. This saw club president Nicholas Gara threatening to pull out of the league in what he termed unfair treatment from the league management. The development saw the “Mushonga unouraya ipapo ipapo” missing training on Tuesday and Wednesday. However, despite the setbacks head coach John Nyikadzino is eager to see his side turning the tide and return to winning ways after a five match winless run, with their best result being a single draw. “It’s a bit tricky that we have not been training for two days but we are going to fight and try and come up with something. We are prepared for the game but we are expecting a tough game. “Our recent results have not been pleasing at all and Triangle have been playing very well. It is incumbent upon us to turn things around and get a result which will be a confidence booster for the boys,” said Nyikadzino. Despite the poor run, Nichrut has shown some flashes of brilliance and can beat any team on any day. Some of the players who have been a revelation for Shurugwi side include Tatenda Hapazari and Nigel Mpinduki. However, Triangle have been uncompromising this season and Nichrut need to be at their best to stop the Sugar Boys onslaught. Last weekend, the Lowveld based outfit Triangle humbled Dynamos 3-0 at Gibbo Stadium. @lavuzigara1
