Lovemore Zigara in Gweru THE Zifa Central Region Soccer League (CSL) has postponed its season kick off to the last weekend of March. CSL had announced that the season will roar to life on March 17, but the regional mother body has rescinded on its earlier decision after most of the clubs failed to adhere to the Fifa Club Licensing System. Only three clubs to date, namely Whawha, Tongogara and FC Platinum Under-19, have managed to submit their papers on time. “There have been administrative changes to our CSL season in the sense that out of the teams that had registered for the season only three have complied the Fifa Club Licensing System and like we said we want our league to be professional. We are therefore, giving clubs until the end of the month to finish the registration exercise,” CSL chairman Stanley Chapeta  said. “We are therefore opening this window to ensure that the clubs are familiar with the system before we close that window. We cannot play without licences so we have had to kick off the league at a later stage,” added Chapeta. The CSL boss reiterated that clubs should ask for assistance for them to go through the registration procedures. The CSL season is going to kick off with the league having secured a $45 000 sponsorship from a Gweru based medical aid company. The Zimbabwe Medical Aid General Fund is set to bankroll this year’s league and the launch of the sponsorship package is set to be held before the season kicks off. The only time the region managed to secure sponsorship was in 2010 when Gweru based electrical company Kayzed Sales injected $20 000 to sponsor the league’s end of year awards. — @lavuzigara1
