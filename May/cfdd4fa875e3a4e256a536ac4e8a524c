 Arsenal want to secure the deal to bring Unai Emery to the Emirates Stadium in the next 72 hours. The 46-year-old Spaniard has been in London to hold talks with the club hierarchy who were hugely impressed with his plans for the club if he were to succeed Arsene Wenger. And while Mikel Arteta is believed to have hesitated about taking the job because of decision-making about transfers, Emery had no such misgivings. He was comfortable with the salary offer of around £5 million a year in a deal which will keep him at Arsenal for three years. And his track record proved that he can achieve success on limited funds. He enjoyed success in Spain where he made Valencia competitive against the financial giants of Real Madrid and Barcelona. He then transformed Sevilla — a club with restricted resources but he took them to three successive Europa League triumphs. That pedigree impressed the powers at Arsenal. Talks are on-going but sources in France suggest it is a done deal and that Emery is likely to be unveiled as Arsenal manager by the end of this week, The plan is for Emery to start making his own backroom staff appointments next week. He will then decide about the roles to be played by Steve Bould and Jens Lehmann who survived the cull of coaches and medical staff last week. Arteta will now resume his role as the right-hand man of Pep Guardiola at Manchester City and will wait for a more suitable offer to kick-start his managerial career. — Mailonline
