 Mashudu Netsianda, Senior Court Reporter A BEITBRIDGE man who allegedly stoned a fellow imbiber to death with a stone weighing more than 2kgs during a beer drinking fight has appeared in court. Life Mulaudzi (22) of Makakavhule village appeared before Bulawayo High Court judge Justice Thompson James Mabhikwa facing a murder charge in connection with the death of Fred Mashele (23). Mulaudzi was remanded in custody to June 26.  Prosecuting, Ms Nokuthaba Ngwenya said on September 10 in 2016 at around 10PM, Delelani Mashele was at a shop verandah at Lutumba Business Centre listening to music when Mulaudzi allegedly snatched his hat before he fled into a nearby nightclub to join his friends who were drinking beer there. The court heard that Delelani followed the accused person. “On arrival at the nightclub, Delelani demanded his hat back from the accused person who however, denied taking it,” said Ms Ngwenya. The deceased who was Delelani’s younger brother and his two friends later arrived at the nightclub. Delelani reported the matter to the trio and the deceased confronted the accused person during which a scuffle ensued between the two men. “The deceased grabbed the accused person by the collar and threatened to assault him if he refused to release the hat,” said Ms Ngwenya. Mulaudzi managed to free himself from Fred’s grip.  He then picked up a stone and struck Fred once on the head. Soon after committing the offence, Mulaudzi ran away with Fred and his colleagues in hot pursuit. They caught up with Mulaudzi and apprehended him before taking him to the police. Fred was taken to Beitbridge District Hospital and was transferred to Mpilo Central Hospital where he later succumbed to the injuries. Mr Thulani Ndlovu of Sansole and Senda Legal Practitioners is representing the accused person. @mashnets
