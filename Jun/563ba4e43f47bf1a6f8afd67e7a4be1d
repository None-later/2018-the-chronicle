President Mnangagwa Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has directed the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing to elevate Hwange Town Council to municipal status. The directive was made after the Minister of State for provincial affairs in Matabeleland North (Cde Cain Mathema) made the request in his welcoming remarks to the President who was the guest of honour at the  $1,5 billion Hwange Thermal Power Station expansion project for Unit 7 and 8 ground breaking ceremony here yesterday.Announcing the directive, Cde Mnangagwa said: “The Minister of State for Matabeleland North (Cde Cain Mathema) talked about Hwange being elevated to municipal status so that there is a single authority running Hwange. “I’m going to dispatch the Ministry of Local Government to work to achieve that requirement. So I’m simultaneously instructing the various small entities that have been running Hwange that that this is now my instruction and you should co-operate.” In his request, Cde Mathema said the people of Matabeleland North wanted Hwange Town Council to be upgraded to a municipality. “Your Excellence, I have been asked by the Hwange community in particular and by Matabeleland North in general to ask you sir to assist us have Hwange upgraded to a municipality so that the place is turned into one local authority called Hwange led by a mayor,” he said. Cde Mathema said Hwange Colliery Company Limited, the Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) and the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) workers wanted to be given ownership of the houses they were occupying. “The workers from the three companies want to be given the ownership of the houses they are occupying given that Government is the biggest single shareholder of the three companies,” he said.—@okazunga.
