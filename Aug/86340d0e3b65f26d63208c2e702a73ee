Guluva 7 Showbiz Correspondent HIP hop musician Guluva 7 has dropped visuals for his song Khanda Cool as a teaser for his forthcoming album titled Command Hustle. The Kasien President as he is known, has been quiet ever since releasing his 2015 album Colour of Dreams that won him a Zim Hip Hop award that year. His latest track Khanda Cool features Lord Skillz and according to his manager Keith Moyo, the video will be dropped later this month. “The music video for Khanda Cool is ready to be released. I’ve watched it and it looks clean. All that’s left is for us to set the date for its release,” said Moyo. The album will feature the likes of award-winning rapper MC Chita as well as his singles Ngena ka1 and Jackie Chen which have   been getting considerable airplay from radio stations. Moyo said Guluva 7 has not released music for the past three years as he has been taking his time in order to avoid releasing half baked products. “Guluva has been cooking music in the studio for the past three years while pursuing some other business interests. He doesn’t want his music to lose value by releasing music every day or be like some who release double albums. “He believes that Colour of Dreams is an album that’ll push his vision as an artiste, but it’s time for him to release Command Hustle,” said Moyo.
