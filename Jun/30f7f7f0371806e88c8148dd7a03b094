Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter TEAM Zimbabwe, which is set to represent the country at the biennial Confederation of Universities and College Sports Association (CUCSA) games, is confident of bringing back gold from the sporting extravaganza that starts in Botswana today. The games which will end on Friday, June 22 are being played in Gaborone. Ten countries; Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe will compete in nine sporting codes. They will battle it out in football, basketball, tennis, table tennis, chess, athletics, netball, karate and volleyball. Tertiary Education Sports Association of Zimbabwe (Tesaz) president Conwell Tigere said: “We have done well in this competition in the past and this year will be no different. In 2016 we hosted the games here in Zimbabwe and we took first place. We are certainly hoping to replicate that performance away from home.” The team was in camp in Gweru before they left for the neighbouring country yesterday.
