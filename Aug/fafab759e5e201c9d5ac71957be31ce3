We have invited various dignitaries that include captains of industry, mining companies, parastatals, government departments as well as influential individuals. We hope to raise between $40 000 and $50 000,” said Kuwengwa. He said the fundraising dinner will have four table categories with 10 each. “Our platinum table will cost $5 000, gold ($2 000), silver ($1 000) and bronze ($500). Those that will occupy the platinum table will be given an opportunity to market their products to the dinner audience. I must also state that the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate has pledged a substantial amount of game meat for the games, while national airline Air Zimbabwe has offered us two return tickets to the majestic Victoria Falls that will be auctioned at the dinner dance,” said Kuwengwa. The local organising committee has set a budget of $1.1 million for hosting the games. Besides various fundraising initiatives, some of the funds will come from participating provinces’ affiliation fees that are pegged at $70 per person. If all the provinces pay their affiliation fees, about $525 000 would be realised.
