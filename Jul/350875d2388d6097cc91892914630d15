DJ Da Kudu Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter ZIMBABWE-born DJ/Producer and sound engineer Irvin “DJ Da_Kudu” Ronney, who is based in Cape Town, South Africa, will be part of the 10 groups that will be battling it out on SABC 1’s new reality competition ‘The Remix SA’ tonight. DJ Da_Kudu is an ambitious music producer who received his education at Eastview College and Christian Brothers College in Bulawayo and is a second year student at the Academy of Sound Engineering in South Africa. He is part of a musical trio called “Black Salt” which consists of vocalist Dimples and MH1, the musical performer. Tonight the group will be battling it out against nine other groups, each made up of a trio of a strong vocalist, DJ/Producer and musical performer. They will compete head to head every week until only one group is left standing. The winners will walk away with an undisclosed cash prize. Groups will be tasked with creating a remix within a given theme or musical genre. Working together, they must create a unique sound and bring new flavour to existing local and international hits. All this while doing justice to the original track. The young producer has worked with some noticeable names in the local Hip Hop scene including Tehn Diamond, Asaph and Blazey Boi and also worked with popular SA House music producers like Mono T and Mash ‘O’. His single “Temporary Connections” featuring Black-Slim was playlisted on Good Hope FM. “I’m looking forward to working more with local talents, the likes of Jah Prayzah, ExQ and Winky D,” he said. The reality segment of the show premiered yesterday while The Remix Unplugged, which takes a behind the scenes look at how contestants prepare for the competition, will premiere on SABC2 tomorrow at 6AM.
