Mr Raj Modi Kudzai Chikiwa, Chronicle Reporter NEWLY elected Zanu-PF Bulawayo South MP Cde Rajesh Modi has said a revolving fund which he launched last month will start processing applications in the next three weeks to fulfil his election promise. In his constituency update, Cde Modi urged Bulawayo South residents to take advantage of the fund and embrace entrepreneurship for sustainable development. Cde Modi launched the fund before the just ended harmonised polls to assist small businesses in his constituency and political affiliation will not be considered when selecting beneficiaries. “People of Bulawayo South need to prepare their business plans and proposals. Make sure your plans are well laid and they point to a sustainable business,’’ he tweeted. Cde Modi said the fund will help those intending to start projects as well as those who already have established ventures that are struggling. “If you already have a business, get your papers ready and let us boost your business,’’ he said “Lets create the Bulawayo South we want.’’ Cde Modi said he will deliver on his election promises. “Now that people have trusted me, l have to deliver what l promised. I prefer acting than merely promising,’’ the MP said. He said people in Bulawayo need jobs and he has faith that the Government will deliver. “Our people need jobs, affordable and quality healthcare. In a nutshell we need good standards of living. I have no doubt that the new government will remove Zimbabwe from the quagmire,’’ he tweeted. Though the fund is specifically for the Bulawayo South residents, Cde Modi said projects that will be established will benefit many communities around Bulawayo. “I can assure you that it’s not only the people of Bulawayo South who will benefit from the empowerment projects. Many people from around will see the great benefit of entrepreneurship,’’ he said. @tamary98
