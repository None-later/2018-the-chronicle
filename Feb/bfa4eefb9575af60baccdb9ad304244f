Carl Joshua Ncube Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent COMEDIAN Carl Joshua Ncube has been roped in by fast-growing Victoria Falls radio station Breeze FM to host a breakfast show alongside Miss Tourism Zimbabwe Ashley Morgen. Called Morning Oa Tunya, the radio gig will be a first for Ncube’s career after having relocated to the resort town last year. It will be launched this Saturday. Ncube and Morgen will be joined by Lesley Phiri for the show that will air everyday from 6AM to 10AM on frequency 91.2FM. Breeze FM however, is only reachable to those within a 40KM radius of Victoria Falls. Ncube, a self appointed Zimbabwe tourism ambassador, said he would use the programme to further promote Brand Zimbabwe. “As I was trying to consolidate on how to market Zimbabwe, I was called in by Breeze FM to work on a breakfast show. As the new self appointed tourism ambassador for Victoria Falls, I’ll ensure that we use the show to talk about everything concerning the resort town in order to inform our international market that visits on a daily basis.” He said at the end of the day, he wanted to get his name known while also helping tourists to find things to do when they are in the resort town. The award winning comedian added that he would also share his jokes on air making it a bonus for Breeze FM listeners as they will always be up to date with the comedian.
