 Descent Dube, Sports Reporter PLANS are afoot to turn the Spar Bonsa T20 Cricket League into a national event following the passion and commitment shown by the sponsors and Old Mutual Heath Streak Academy. The league, which reaches the halfway stage on Sunday, has attracted 90 players from the national, provincial, first, second and third leagues as well as schools. Teams taking part in the league are Raptors, Tigers, Sabres, Blazers, Badgers and the Hawks. Spar Bonsa T20 tournament director Duncan Frost said the league was set to grow into a larger franchise that will benefit the game beyond Bulawayo. “The concept and vision has become a reality through the commitment and passion of the Old Mutual Heath Streak Academy and Heath Streak himself, and the drive shown by Spar Bonsa, the sponsors,” said Frost. “Ninety players turning up every weekend with organised umpires and scorers, a post-match interview and match of the match awards make it a spectacle every Sunday.” Frost said one of their major objectives was to make the league very competitive as the sponsors seek to grow it into a national event. Among the registered players in the league are national team players John Nyumbu and Christopher Mpofu as well as Matabeleland Tuskers’ Thabo Mboyi, Cunningham Ncube, Ernest Masuku, Njabulo Ncube, Ainsley Ndlovu, Bright Phiri, Thamsanqa Nunu and Steve Chinamiyo. Former national team skipper and coach Streak said the league will play a massive role in developing new standards set for new tournaments. “All involved feel that this will be good for cricket and the Bulawayo community has shown players, umpires, schools, clubs and fans what can be achieved with properly organised structures and management,” Streak said. The league started on July 1 and ends on August 26.
