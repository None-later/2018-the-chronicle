AMBASSADORS of Zimbabwe Football will stage a soccer match pitting Bulawayo Legends against their Harare counterparts at Luveve Stadium on December 15. The match is aimed at raising money for yesteryear stars’ medical funds. Bulawayo Legends’ organising secretary Hebert Dick said Zimbabwean football is not doing well in general and former players don’t have a platform to interact after hanging their boots. “This game is meant to bring us together as former players and try to bridge divisions. We want to be one and have invited Zifa officials to grace the event as it must be known that this isn’t a political game, but a way of tackling our problems as former players,” said Dick. He said the organisation still needs donations towards the game, which they estimate will raise $7 000. “We have engaged a number of corporates as a way of raising funds and we’re now waiting for feedback. We’re optimistic of reaching our target,” Dick
Mike Dube, who is one of the participants, described the initiative as a necessity to show appreciation to the country’s legends, most of who find it hard to cater for their day-to-day financial needs. Dube said among invited participants are Elliot Matsika, Joel Luphahla, Ronald Gidiza Sibanda, Philip Sithole, Johanes Ngodzo and Methembe Ndlovu, among others. “It’s high time we come up with ideas to counter problems facing our legends head-on and set a higher bar every year. We are hoping this will be an annual event and that it gets better every year so that we generate funds to help our living legends,” said Dube Dick said the event is open to all former players as they try to create a platform for everyone who wants to start somewhere after retiring. The curtain raisers of the tournament will be Highlanders Under-18 versus Bulawayo City Council Under-18 at 1pm. Adults’ entry fees is $2, with children Under-12 paying $1.
