Deputy Minister Davis Marapira From George Maponga in Masvingo ZIMBABWE has sealed a deal with India for the delivery of 500 tractors as part of efforts to mechanise the agricultural sector and boost productivity on the farms. Agriculture, Lands and Rural Resettlement Deputy Minister Cde Davis Marapira said the light and heavy-duty tractors were sourced from the Asian nation under a Government to Government agreement. “We will soon be taking delivery of some tractors from India that were sourced under a Government to Government agreement though I cannot disclose the figures involved. We expect the equipment to start arriving in the country within the next three months,’’ he said. Government sources, however, said about 500 tractors are set to be delivered. “The tractors will be for small-scale and large-scale commercial farmers and they will pay for them at relaxed terms. All this is part of a cocktail of measures introduced by Government to mechanise the agricultural sector and increase production,’’ said Deputy Minister Marapira. Cde Marapira said the equipment from India would complement what Belarus, China and Brazil have offered. Besides tractors, Government was also taking delivery of irrigation equipment such as centre-pivots as the nation shifts from over-reliance on rain-fed agriculture. Cde Marapira said distribution of the irrigation equipment would be given to both small-scale and large-scale irrigation schemes countrywide. “We do not have second thoughts on irrigation schemes when it comes to giving them farming and irrigation equipment on credit because we are guaranteed that they will pay back because they will have produced,’’ said Cde Marapira. President Mnangagwa’s Government is prioritising the revival of the agricultural sector as part of ensuring food security and reviving the economy. Government has since expanded the Command Agriculture scheme to cover not only maize but also soya beans, cotton and tobacco as it seeks to boost the economy.
