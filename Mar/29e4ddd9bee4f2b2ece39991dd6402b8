Nelson Chamisa Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief MDC-T leader, Mr Nelson Chamisa, has praised President Mnangagwa for masterminding the resignation of former president Robert Mugabe ushering in a new era for the country. Addressing hundreds of MDC-T Alliance supporters at Mkoba Stadium in Gweru yesterday Mr Chamisa said President Mnangagwa had done what they sought for years, but failed. Mr Chamisa said his party had previously failed to remove Mr Mugabe through the ballot. President Mnangagwa has been preaching the gospel of free, fair and credible elections since assuming office last November. Mr Mugabe whom critics say was a dictator, gave in to the will of the people and resigned as parliament had launched proceedings to impeach him. Mr Chamisa claimed that he would win the elections. “This year we will form the new Government after the elections. We will tell (President Mnangagwa) and thank him that he indeed prepared the way for us. He was the bridge we needed to cross into this new era. We couldn’t have done it without (President) Mnangagwa,” he said. “ED was a bridge linking us. We could have not removed Mugabe from Government. We had tried and failed.”
