 Business Reporter REASERCH from Trade Map indicates that spices are a high value cash crop, which horticulture farmers in Zimbabwe should consider growing more, Zimtrade has said. Capsicum (pepper) comprises the bulk of the global spice trade, taking up 45 percent of all traded spices in 2016 with an estimated value of $4.7 billion, it said. According to Trade Map, in 2002, Zimbabwe was the largest capsicum exporter in Africa (41.1 percent of Africa’s exports or dried or crushed or ground fruits from the genus capsicum), exporting $16.7 million of peppers. Production of peppers in Zimbabwe has, however, declined by 94 percent from this figure to $1.1 million in 2016. “There is a growing demand for natural healthier food additives, which are making spice oils and natural colouring agents increasingly popular, especially in Europe,” said ZimTrade in its latest monthly newsletter. “Indeed, the market has grown by more than 368 percent since 2002 to reach the $4.6 billion mark in 2016. The largest importers of pepper and paprika were United States of America, and Germany, while the largest exporters were Vietnam, India and China.” ZimTrade said Zimbabwe’s conducive climate has the country well-positioned to compete with these countries. “Horticulture producers in Zimbabwe are therefore encouraged to explore the huge capsicum-growing opportunity,” said the trade agency, which has since pledged to assist local farmers by providing market intelligence, conducting market research, as well as offering export development and promotion services.
