ABSA Premiership side Baroka FC have temporarily shut the door on vultures that are hovering over their star player Talent Chawapiwa. According to South African media, the Telkom Knockout Cup champions will only be in a position to release the former FC Platinum winger at the end of the 2018/19 season as they bid to stay clear of the relegation battle. Club chief executive officer Morgan Mammila told Kickoff.com that they will not consider any offers for the Warriors winger amid reports that giants Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns are after the dribbling menace. AmaZulu are also said to be pushing very hard to get the 26-year-old Zimbabwean international to make a move to Durban, but Bakgaga will not consider any offers that come their way for the talented winger. “To be honest there is nothing on my table and the player will finish the season with us. We will only entertain offers at the end of the current season,” Mammila is quoted saying by KickOff.Com. In October this year Chawapiwa revealed that he almost joined Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs during the August transfer window, but the deal somehow fell through. “It was true because my agent spoke to the Chiefs guys, but I don’t know what happened in the end. [The deal] was almost closed. “[But] it’s all about remaining disciplined as a person, because if you allow that to get into your head then your performance will go down. It’s about staying calm and hoping for the best in the future.” At Chiefs the diminutive winger would have joined up with fellow Zimbabweans Teenage Hadebe, Khama Billiat and Willard Katsande.
