 Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter THREE people died while one was injured in a road accident that occurred at the 70km peg along the Bulawayo–Tsholotsho Road near the St James High school turn-off. Bulawayo Chief Fire Officer Mr Richard Peterson confirmed the accident which occurred at around 4PM on Sunday. He said a Toyota Runx, registration Number ADK 4243, veered off the road and rammed into a tree. “The brigade extricated the victims who were trapped and three of them had already died at the time of retrieval while one person was injured. The injured and the bodies of the deceased persons were all conveyed to Mpilo Central Hospital. “It is suspected the private motor vehicle veered off the road due to speeding on a strip road and rammed against a tree. We warn motorists to be cautious when driving especially on strip roads,” Mr Peterson said. Matabeleland North police spokesperson Chief Inspector Siphiwe Makonese could not comment on the accident, referring questions to the National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi who could not be reached as his phones went unanswered.
