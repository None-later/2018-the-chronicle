We are treating the match against Zimbabwe as a must-win. “We want to go as far as claiming the World Cup berth. We are no pushovers as we have a lot of good players in our ranks. “Our players are dotted around the world playing competitive rugby against some of the best the world has in terms of the game. “The game against Zimbabwe will, obviously, be tough.’’
