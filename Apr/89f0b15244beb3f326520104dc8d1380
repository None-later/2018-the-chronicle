Tendai Ndoro Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THIRTEEN Zimbabwean players’ future in the Absa Premiership in South Africa is uncertain heading into this afternoon’s league matches. Ajax Cape Town, home to Gerald Takwara and Tendai Ndoro, occupy the relegation playoff slot and have a tricky duel against championship eyeing Mamelodi Sundowns who are home to Warriors’ Khama Billiat. A loss for Ajax Cape Town and wins by Supersport United, Polokwane City, Bidvets Wits, Baroka  and Golden Arrows will condemn the Urban Warriors to the playoffs where a return to the Premiership is not guaranteed. However, other Zimbabwean players, Onesimo Bhasera, Kingstone Nkhatha, Evans Rusike, on-loan Prince Dube who play for Super Sport United, George Chigova, Walter Musona and Dominic Chungwa who are with Polokwane City, Talent Chawapihwa who turns out for Baroka  and the quartet of Danny Phiri, Thomas Chideu, Kuda Mahachi and Knox Mutizwa  who are with Golden Arrows are all not guaranteed of Premiership football heading into this afternoon’s action especially if five of the teams post wins. They will have to wait for the last games of the season next week. The sad state of affairs could be worrying for the Warriors coach Sunday Chidzambwa as all the 13 players are key members of his Total African Nations Cup qualifiers squad. Absa Premiership relegation playoffs fixtures today Golden Arrows v Platinum Stars, Free State v Polokwane City, Chippa United v Supersport United, Mamelodi Sundowns v Ajax Cape Town, Baroka v Bloemfoentein.
