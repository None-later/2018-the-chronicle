 Mexico City – Authorities in the Pacific coast Mexican state of Nayarit say they are investigating the remains of at least 30 people found in a series of clandestine graves. The Nayarit state prosecutor’s office says in a statement that bodies and bones were found. A state official says the remains of at least 30 people were found in three clustered graves in the municipality of Xalisco. The official says they were in an area beside a stream that is difficult to access. Some families searching for missing loved ones found remains on Saturday after being tipped off by local residents. The official says there was a spike in disappearances in the region from June to September after the area’s most powerful organised crime group splintered. — AP.
