Assad Vala Mehluli Sibanda, Senior Sports Reporter AFTER their ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier first warm-up match against Ireland was abandoned due to a wet Queens Sports Club outfield, Zimbabwe have the last chance to test their strength when they take on Papua New Guinea at Bulawayo Athletic Club today. Zimbabwe’s clash with Ireland could not take place on Tuesday after the umpires deemed the wet outfield too dangerous for the players, resulting in it being cancelled without a ball being bowled. PNG on the other hand had their warm-up match against Scotland at BAC, with the Scots winning by seven wickets. Assad Vala, the PNG captain, described the clash with Zimbabwe as a great opportunity for them to test themselves against great opponents for them to head into the competition with self belief. “It’s really good opposition (against) a Test playing country. It’s a really good chance to test ourselves heading into the real games. We want to go in with a lot of confidence, so this game is really important for us,” said Vala. Zimbabwe are likely to give Cephas Zhuwao a chance to prove himself ahead of their opening group match against Nepal on Sunday. The explosive left-hander is most likely to open the batting and try to cement his place in the team for the tournament. Warm up matches Today: UAE v West Indies(Harare Sports Club), Afghanistan v Netherlands (Old Hararians), Hong Kong v Nepal (Kwekwe Sports Club), Zimbabwe V PNG (BAC), Scotland v Ireland (Queens Sports Club). @Mdawini_29
