 Lovemore Zigara, Midlands Bureau FAST food chain, Simbisa Brands is set to open two outlets in Kwekwe in the next two months as it spreads its wings to maintain market dominance on the local market. Simbisa already operates Nando’s, Chicken Inn, Creamy Inn, Bakers Inn as well as Pizza Inn in the gold mining town. The company’s operations manager for Kwekwe Mr Xolisani Gama said the giant food chain was set to add Steers to its lines as well as opening another Chicken Inn and Baker’s Inn branch. “The plans are there. Going forward we should be opening a Steers in Kwekwe and we should be having another Chicken Inn and Baker’s Inn in the city,” said Mr Gama. The company, which is listed on the local bourse, has been on a massive expansion drive. In February it announced intentions to acquire an international restaurant group subject to shareholders and regulatory approvals. Its expansion drive dates back to 2015 when it was unbundled from Innscor. Simbisa operates in 11 countries with Zimbabwe enjoying a 45 percent market share of the 434 outlets it has mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Meanwhile, last Tuesday Simbisa provided lunch to patients at Kwekwe General Hospital. Mr Gama said the gesture was part of the company’s programme of ploughing back to the communities that support its business. Kwekwe Hospital acting medical superintendent Dr Mike Matambo said the lunch meant a lot to the patients. “It is the mental state of our patients that speeds up the healing process,” said Dr Matambo. Simbisa Brands are Chicken Inn, Pizza Inn, Baker’s Inn, Fish Inn, Nandos, Steers, and Creamy Inn and  the company employs about 3 000 workers countrywide. @lavuzigara1
