 Thandeka Moyo, Health Reporter A RESEARCH department within the World Health Organisation (WHO) has announced that the consumption of bacon is as deadly as smoking and can lead to colorectal cancer. According to WHO, a report conducted by its research department, the International Agency of Research into cancer shows that there is sufficient evidence to show that the consumption of processed meat causes colorectal cancer. “Two strips of bacon increases the risk to colorectal cancer by 5,9 percent and the risk increases with each strip. Those who take six strips have a risk of up to 7,7 percent and 10 strips come with a 9,5 percentage risk,” says WHO. Colorectal cancer affects the colon and the rectum and symptoms include changes in bowel habits, changes in stool consistency, blood in the stool and abdominal discomfort. “Meat consists of multiple components, such as harem iron. Meat can also contain chemicals that form during meat processing or cooking. For instance, carcinogenic chemicals that form during meat processing include N-nitroso compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,” reads the report. The organization says the cooking of red meat or processed meat also produces heterocyclic aromatic amines as well as other chemicals including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. WHO places cured and processed meats like sausages in the same category as asbestos, alcohol, arsenic and tobacco and says their continued consumption may be harmful. — @thamamoe.
