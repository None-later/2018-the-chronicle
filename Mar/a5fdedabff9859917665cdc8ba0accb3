Honest Moyo Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS captain Honest Moyo has apologised to his teammates and club supporters for his moment of madness that saw him receiving a straight red card in the VP Kembo Mohadi Charity Shield match against Caps United at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday. Bosso won the match 2-1, but could have easily lost due to their numerical disadvantage following Moyo’s stupid sending off for head-butting Caps United goal scorer Brian Muzondiwa in an off the ball incident. Muzondiwa seemed to stamp on Moyo, who had fallen at the southern grandstand, popularly known as “empankhweni”, but the referee allowed play to continue, as Highlanders still had possession and were attacking. Probably feeling hard done by, Moyo stood up and charged towards Muzondiwa and head-butted him in full view of the referee, who didn’t hesitate to flash the red card. “I want to apologise to my teammates, coaches and our passionate supporters for what happened on Sunday. My behaviour was not expected of a senior player like me and a captain for that matter. I overreacted and it will not happen again in future. My sending off could have cost the team the match, which would have been a sad thing. Although we won, I still feel very bad about it and apologise to everyone associated with this great institution as well as the match organisers. Ngaphambanisa ngicela uxolo (I messed up and ask for forgiveness),” said Moyo. The sending off of Moyo forced Highlanders to change their tactics to contain the marauding Caps United frontline, which was sensing blood. “Before that red card incident, we were actually planning to go on the offensive by changing our strategy, but we had to review that decision,” said coach Madinda Ndlovu in his post match interview. Ndlovu was still happy with his boys’ overall discipline despite Moyo’s red card. @skhumoyo2000
