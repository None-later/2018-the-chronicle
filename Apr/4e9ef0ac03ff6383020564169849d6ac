 Nyaradzo Bakari, Chronicle Reporter A MAN from Harare who allegedly defrauded three Bulawayo companies of more than $15 000 by forging Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) payments has been issued with a warrant of arrest after he absconded court yesterday. Malvin Jones (38) defaulted court after he had been granted free bail by Bulawayo magistrate Mr Franklin Mkhwananzi last Thursday. Jones allegedly connived with Wilfred Kupara alias Kupa and Revai Chimedza alias Patience Moyo and Kudakwashe Mureya (pseudonym) to defraud the companies of $15 741. The court heard that Jones’ accomplices are still at large. The quartet would allegedly order goods from IMEX Tyres Zimbabwe, Redgwoods Distributors Pvt Ltd and Universal Batteries Pvt Ltd and produce fake RTGS payments as proof of payment before collecting the purchased goods. On his initial appearance, Jones pleaded not guilty to three counts of fraud before Mr Mkhwananzi. Prosecuting, Mr Maclean Ndlovu said Jones defrauded the companies between February and March this year. He said Jones defrauded Redgwoods Distributors of hydraulic hoses worth $8 575, IMEX Tyres Zimbabwe of tyres worth $3 852 and Universal Batteries of car batteries worth $3 314 by forging RTGS payments. “The accused persons contacted the complainant inquiring about goods they offer. The complainants sent the accused the quotations. The accused persons, using pseudonyms, approached the complainants and tendered fake RTGS forms in the name of Insiza Mine as proof of payment for the purchase of various goods,” he said. “By means of this misrepresentation, the complainants released goods to the accused, resulting in them suffering a prejudice of $15 741.” Mr Ndlovu said Jones was arrested after police received a tip off leading to the recovery of property worth $6 035. @NyarieBakie
