Tinashe Nengomasha FORMER Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Tinashe Nengomasha has urged his countryman Khama Billiat to make the right decision to safeguard his future. Billiat has been linked with a move away from Sundowns and has been linked with both local and overseas clubs. A move to Europe where he’d follow in the footsteps of his good friends Keagan Dolly and Bongani Zungu would most probably excite him the most, but at age 27 the former Ajax Cape Town man is unlikely to get an opportunity to play in countries such as England, Spain and France. Nengomasha feels the player would get a good chance to prove himself in countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Belgium. “I sit on the fence with this one because sometimes when you talk Europe there are those Scandinavian countries that can have his talent, but when you talk of England, France and Spain there are kids who are buzzing there. If you look at (Kylian) Mbappe, he’s like 21 or 22 , so I think it’s a little bit out of the question. I hope whoever is doing his transfer is doing the right thing and is making the right decision,” said Nengomasha. “At his age he needs to make the right decision because most of these boys are labelled old when they get to age 30. So you need to make the right decision to make your future good. He is my homeboy and he is a friend of mine so I wish him good luck.” Even if Billiat does not leave Sundowns, Nengomasha believes the player can still take his football to another level at Chloorkop. “He will get to another level. He has his own special talent. A happy Khama can do anything on the pitch at the end of the day and I think he can still get to another level at Sundowns. But it depends how much Sundowns are willing to make him happy.” – KickOff.com
