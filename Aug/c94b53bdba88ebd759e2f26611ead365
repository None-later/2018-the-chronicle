Lifa Ncube Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter TRIANGLE United chairman, Lovemore Matikinyidze, is likely to take over leadership of the Premier Soccer League, with  his  Chicken Inn  counterpart Lifa Ncube coming in as deputy when the PSL holds its elections on September 9. Matikinyidze will be vying to succeed former Highlanders’ chairman Peter Dube, who, however, did not complete his term after being suspended by Zifa over a number of charges. Sources close to the power matrix told Chronicle Sport that Caps United president Farai Jere, who almost became the league’s boss on July 14 before a constitutional anomaly was raised after he was nominated by a Division One club, also threw in his name at the close of the nomination process yesterday. It, however, seems that clubs have already settled for the Lowveld-based human resources fundi, who is also a member of the Zifa human resources sub-committee chaired by the association’s vice-president Omega Sibanda. “Jere made the grave mistake of trying to force his way into the leadership via unconstitutional means and that did not go down well with the clubs, hence their decision to back Matikinyidze’s candidacy. Even if he decides to throw his name into the hat, the dice has already been cast, we are going with Matikinyidze and Ncube,” said a source. The source said Bulawayo City boss Jerry Sibanda was also approached, but he was worried by his team’s current poor performance and felt that he might not render full concentration to the league as he tries to save his club. “However, Sibanda being a finance person could lead the league’s finance committee,” revealed the source. Highlanders’ chairman Kenneth Mhlophe said he did not put his name for selection and was comfortable with being led by anyone at the moment. “I have no problem with whoever will become the new PSL chairman,” said Mhlophe, who became Highlanders’ chairman early this year.
