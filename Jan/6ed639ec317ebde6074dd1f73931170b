 Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent THE Registrar General’s Office is working on opening a passport office in Matabeleland North provincial capital, Lupane next month. Matabeleland North provincial registrar Mr Willard Sayenda said the opening of the passport office will complete the department’s relocation from Bulawayo. He said the relocation exercise is part of the department’s 100-day target under President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s administration. The Lupane passport office is expected to be opened on February 23. “Our target is to relocate the provincial Registry from Bulawayo to Lupane. We are on track. “We are going to meet it within our 100 day target. We want to relocate all our records departments from Bulawayo to Lupane, meaning we are going to be opening a passport office in Lupane,” said Mr Sayenda. He said the RG’s office was already processing documents such as birth and death certificates in Lupane. Mr Sayenda said the challenge they were facing was that of accommodation but it was being addressed. Recently, the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs Matabeleland North Cde Cain Mathema said the provision of a conducive working environment such as proper housing was important in retaining civil servants. He said the country could learn from what was happening during the colonial era when civil servants were provided with Government houses. Cde Mathema said sometimes the country is needlessly losing critical staff because of the failure to create a conducive working environment. @nqotshili
