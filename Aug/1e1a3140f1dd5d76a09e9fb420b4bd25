 Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter VOLLEYBALL player Tawanda Mafuva is in the Czech Republic for trials with top club Kladno in a move that will see him becoming the first Zimbabwean to play the game professionally in Europe if he makes the grade. The country has previously exported numerous talented players to South Africa and Botswana, but is yet to tap into the more lucrative European market. “Volleyball star Mafuva is in the Czech Republic for the next three weeks for trials. The national team player is based in South Africa. His trial stint is with Kladno Volleyball Club, which is rated second best in the Czech Republic,” said the Zimbabwe National Volleyball League. Mafuva is an opposite and outside hitter, who has played for several local and regional teams, which include Bulldogs Volleyball Club (Zim), CBZ Jewels (Zim), Diphatsa (Botswana), Uni Jozi (South Africa) as well as University of the Western Cape (South Africa). In 2014 he was crowned the most valuable player and best attacker whilst playing for Uni Jozi in the National Clubs Championship. He was awarded the Most Valuable Player in the 2016 National Volleyball League in CBZ Jewels’ colours. He has 30 plus national team caps to his name since 2007, participating in African Cup qualifiers, All-Africa Games qualifiers, FIVB World Cup qualifiers and FIVB World Championship qualifiers.
