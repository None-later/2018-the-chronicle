ALL is set for the 2018 Africa Open Hockey Series that kicks off at Kumalo Hockey Stadium tomorrow. The three-day tournament will see three ladies’ teams, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Zambia, tussling for the title in a round robin format, with the side that emerges tops taking the crown. In the men’s category, Zimbabwe will face Egypt, Namibia and Zambia. Hockey Association of Zimbabwe (Haz) president Grant Campbell said all was in place to make the event a success. “We had good preparations and both our teams did a lot of training, so we are confident the country will be represented well in this competition. “The Zimbabwe men’s team trooped into camp over the weekend and they have been using facilities at Kumalo Hockey Stadium to sharpen their skills. “The women’s team will start their camp today (yesterday) since they only have two matches. “Egypt will be flying into the country today (yesterday), while the rest of the teams are expected in the country tomorrow (today) since they are coming by road,” said Campbell. Meanwhile, Haz conducted a five-day coaching clinic at Kumalo Hockey Stadium. “In Bulawayo we have quite a strong schools’ section in hockey, but as they get older the league is small. “Since our national team is in Bulawayo, up-and-coming hockey players got a chance to train with the senior squad and get some coaching from them. “We hope this coaching clinic will go a long way in helping aspiring players to pursue the game up to professional level,” Campbell said.
