Zahara Mzansi songstress Zahara, real name, Bulelwa Mkutukana, is one of the best vocalists to come out of South Africa. The singer who by her standards has been rather quiet as of late, has announced that she will be heading to the United Kingdom later on this year to represent Mzansi at a special Nelson Mandela Concert to be held there. “I just received great news, I’ve been chosen by the people in the UK to represent South Africa at the up and coming Nelson Mandela Concert happening later this year,” she shared on her social media accounts. The Phendula hit-maker also told TshisaLIVE that she was extremely excited to be going to the UK and that she would use the platform given to her to educate those abroad about Madiba’s legacy. “I am very excited to be performing at the concert. As far as I know, I am the only South African woman to perform at the concert. The final programme isn’t finalised yet, but I have been asked to give speeches before about Tata’s legacy,” she told the publication. Zahara will soon be followed to the UK by compatriot and rapper Cassper Nyovest who is also set to show the British what Mzansi has to offer later on this year.— Dailysun.
