Sports Reporter BULAWAYO-based Zimpapers’ sports journalists were yesterday recognised for their coverage of the country’s prestigious development soccer tournament Copa Coca-Cola. Copa Coca-Cola is a youth soccer tournament that unites over one million teens around the world, encouraging values such as team spirit, friendship and respect. The 30th edition of the tournament, which includes both boys and girls, will be held from next month. Chronicle Senior Sports Reporter Ricky Zililo, Sunday News Senior Sports Reporter Mehluli Sibanda, B-Metro Senior Sports Reporter Fungai Muderere and Umthunywa Sports Reporter Nkosilathi Sibanda were recognised for their coverage of COPA Coca-Cola tournaments in the region. Presenting awards to journalists at an appreciation ceremony held in Harare, Coca-Cola senior brand manager Vee Chibanda commended the journalists for their part in covering the sport in all corners of Zimbabwe. “As we celebrate this journey; the journey we have travelled together with you members of the media, we are very cognisant of the fact that COPA Coca-Cola would not have reached this far if we did not have scribes like you, who recognise the importance of grassroots soccer. I want to salute you for the tremendous work that you have done to promote this tournament,” said Chibanda. Delta Sparkling Beverages national sales executive Tich Chipangura echoed Chibanda’s sentiments. “I want to express our deepest gratitude and our sincere appreciation to you members of the media for the invaluable role you play to make sure Copa Coca-Cola is a successful tournament,” Chipangura said. Besides the Zimpapers’ Bulawayo quartet, other journalists from the stable that were also recognised are Elina Mhlanga of The Herald, Ray Bande (Manica Post), Lee Maidza (H-Metro) and the Star FM duo of Spencer Banda and Muziwethu Hadebe.
