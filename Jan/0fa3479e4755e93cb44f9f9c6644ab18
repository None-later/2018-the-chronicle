 Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent My Zimbabwe Gospel Concert held at the Large City Hall on Saturday attracted hundreds of Christians who prayed for peace during the forthcoming harmonised elections. The show was headlined by Lebo Sekgobela of the Lion of Judah fame. Her song which is sung in English, Shona and Sotho, was one of 2016’s biggest hits, proving that gospel music can compete with genres like kwaito, house and hip hop for Song of the Year at the Metro FM Awards. During her debut show in Zimbabwe, Lebo said people should be optimistic. “We are already seeing the peace, we’re already seeing the prosperity of this country and the financial breakthrough of this country and the rising economy of this country. “I don’t want you to be like the children of Israel, I don’t want you to doubt. But if God said to Moses I’ll take you out of the land of Egypt don’t doubt because he knows,” said Lebo during her performance. The others who performed at the concert were Mai Mwamuka, Women of Valour, Dunamis Men, Conquerors, Gospel Unplugged. One of the church leaders Reverend Bekezela Ndlovu, quoted 2 Chronicles chapter 7 verse 15: “if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.” The purpose of the concert was for people to register as voters and a team of Zimbabwe Electoral Commission officials were at the Large City Hall car park registering people. Entrance to the show was $5 and it was free for those who had registered to vote.
