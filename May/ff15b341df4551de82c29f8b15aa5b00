 Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter TSHOLOTSHO coach Joseph Sibindi has blasted Southern Region Division One League new boys CIWU for verbally abusing him after his team came from a goal down to draw 1-1 at Luveve Stadium on Sunday. CIWU took an early lead through Enias Chaora before Tinashe Mthimkhulu, who is on loan at Tsholotsho from Chicken Inn, levelled matters. While accepting that CIWU gave them a good run for their money, Sibindi was not amused with their “unsporting” behaviour. “Our biggest undoing was conceding an early goal. It was a good game and our opponents gave us a good run. They (CIWU) played well and showed character. However, I realised that they have a big problem and need to revisit Law 12 (fouls and misconduct). If they are not conversant with it, they have to look for someone to interpret it for them because they were a nuisance, not only to the referee, but even to me,” said Sibindi. “To be honest I was hurt with their verbal attack. They accused us of bribing the referee, which is a serious allegation. Honestly, why should we pay a referee when we can’t even pay the players bonuses? The powers that be should address this matter,” he said. Referee Happy Mabhena flashed two red cards to Tsholotsho striker Stanley Ngala and CIWU defender Arthur Ndlovu. CIWU coach Kudzai Mhandire was also ejected from the bench and was not on the touchline when his technical team verbally assaulted Sibindi. The weekend result saw Tsholotsho stretching their unbeaten run to seven games, and in the process remain at the top of the table with 15 points, one ahead of Hwange. For CIWU, it was a big result as the newcomers moved a place up the table into fourth. “It’s unfortunate that there was a melee during the game, but I wasn’t part of it. We will look into it. But I’m happy with how we are progressing and being in the top four at this stage is quite encouraging for a small team like ours. We’ve been working hard and it’s showing on the field. The boys are giving their best,” said Mhandire. Some of the players that have been driving CIWU’s cause include the trio of attacking linkman Muziwakhe Dlamini, left-sided midfielder Percy Maphosa and right-back Nqobizitha Nkomo, who were with Bosso 90 last season, former Casmyn striker Brian Muza and ex-Hwange development goalkeeper Nkosana Maseko. Meanwhile, Hwange survived a scare as they had to fight from a goal down to beat NRZ Leopards 2-1 in Dete and in the process close in on Tsholotsho to keep their title hopes alive. Makomo slipped into third place following a 1-1 draw against ZRP Bulawayo, while ZPC Hwange moved two places up the table to fifth following a 1-0 win over Casmyn.
