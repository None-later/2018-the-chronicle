 Andile Tshuma, Chronicle Reporter THE Meteorological Services Department has said the prevailing cold weather conditions will continue into the next month. Speaking in a telephone interview, the MSD officer on duty Mr Ebedia Hodera said although temperatures are expected to get warmer tomorrow, there will be more cold spells expected to end in August. “Our winter season ends in August so the public can expect more cold weather episodes between now and end of next month as we will still be in winter,” he said. Mr Hodera urged the public to carry warm and appropriate clothing when travelling as the weather was unpredictable. Temperatures dropped from Sunday evening across the Southern region with Bulawayo recording a maximum of 13 degrees Celsius on Monday afternoon. Mr Hodera said the extreme cold experienced over recent weeks had not broken records in the region as the coldest temperatures experienced in the country were minus four degrees in Gweru and 0,6 degrees Celsius for Bulawayo in 1975. The MSD said the cold spell was due to pressure surges from the south east coast in South Africa pushing moist airflow into the country. It said temperatures were expected to gradually rise starting tomorrow.
