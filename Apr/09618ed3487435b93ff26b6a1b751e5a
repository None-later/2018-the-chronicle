Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter FEARS have been raised over Midlands province’s ability to host to this year’s combined Zimbabwe National Paralympics and Youth Games after delegates at the National Games Assembly held in Gweru agreed to treble athletes from the local organising committee’s initial figure of 4 257. After the two-day indaba also attended by Midlands Provincial Affairs Minister Owen Ncube and officials from the Ministry of Sport, Arts and Recreation, delegates agreed to increase the number to 13 697. The games, which will see the introduction of Under-13 athletes competing in athletics, football, netball, swimming and tennis, are only four months away. The Under-18s will battle it out in 12 different categories with 3 030 athletes and officials expected. Paralympics athletes and officials will total 1 060 and these will bring the total figure to 5 300 under Block One from August 15-20. Block Two is made up of Under-23s from geographical and virtual provinces as well as the Open Paralympics. These will total 8 397 athletes and officials for the games from August 21-27. The local organising committee had all along been preparing for a figure far less than the one approved by the General Assembly and some observers have raised concerns about the province’s ability to successfully host the event. Participation fees were increased from $20 to $70 per participant in a bid to raise enough money to fund the games. The government challenged organisers to brand the sporting jamboree, as it represents the epitome of sporting excellence in the country. Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Minister Raymond Kazembe said it was worrying that since their inception in 2003, the games still have no corporate sponsorship.
