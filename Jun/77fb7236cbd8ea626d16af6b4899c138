Khama Billiat KHAMA Billiat’s representative has revealed that his camp is in no rush to make a decision about the Mamelodi Sundowns playmaker’s immediate future. Billiat has been heavily linked with a move away from Masandawana, with his contract set to come to an end on June 30. While it is known that the Brazilians are eager to hold onto the Zimbabwean international’s services, the player’s camp is in no rush to make a decision about where the Sundowns’ star will be playing his football next season. The Siya crew contacted the player’s representative Mike Ngobeni of M-Sport-Management, who confirmed that the player’s camp is taking its time in ensuring that it makes the best decision for both Billiat and his family. “We are not rushing anything because his contract is only ending next month (end of June), so we are not rushing any deal because we have got time to make up our minds and see what’s next for the player. We have to make a bold decision and not an emotional decision you know. There is nothing to be emotional about, we need to make sure that we make a bold decision for Khama and his family and his future,” Ngobeni said. The playmaker has been linked with a move to the likes of Bidvest Wits, Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs, while clubs abroad have also shown interest in his services. Billiat recently helped Sundowns to lift their eighth Absa Premiership trophy, being instrumental in head coach Pitso Mosimane’s side during the 2017/18 campaign when fit.  The Zimbabwean also won the Caf Champions League and the Caf Super Cup with Sundowns. — Soccer Laduma
