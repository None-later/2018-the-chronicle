 Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent JUDGES for local singing talent competition, Loud Africa, were overwhelmed in Bulawayo at the weekend as hundreds of talented musicians from the city turned up for auditions that were held at Crystal Night Club. Both the young and old pitched up for the auditions that were concluded on Sunday, for their chance to win $30 000 in prizes which is up for grabs. With national auditions having been concluded in Bulawayo, the show, which is being hosted by Pablo’z Productions in partnership with African Fire Media, is set to start airing on ZBCtv at the end of this month. One of the judges, The Zazalicious One (real name Zandile Ndlovu), said the competition got stiffer after the Bulawayo auditions. “There were so many talented musicians that came through over the three days and we were so overwhelmed. I can say 98 percent of those who came through for the auditions made it to the next round. “The ones who didn’t make it didn’t because the others were just too good. Bulawayo will definitely pose a serious challenge to the other cities,” she said. The Zazalicious One said young contestants and groups stood out. “There were young people aged between 16 and 19 years who stood out during the auditions. One young lady from Girls College, I think her name is Lubelihle – is amazing as she has a powerful voice. The groups also excelled especially one called Roots – they were amazing.” She said as they are now done with the auditions, they are going to phase two of the competition. “We’re now going to phase two where those who qualified will be meeting the judges. We’ll be starting with Harare. “In this phase, we want to cut down the number of people who will vie for the top prize to 200,” said The Zazalicious One. The Loud Africa final is set to take place before December this year and will be screened on ZBCtv.
