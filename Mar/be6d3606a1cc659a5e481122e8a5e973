Lizwe Sweswe Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter FC PLATINUM has appointed Lizwe Sweswe as acting head coach in the absence of Norman Mapeza who is on sick leave. The club, however, did not disclose the nature of the former Warriors midfielder’s ailment but confirmed that he is on sick leave. FC Platinum rubbished social media reports that Mapeza has been relieved of his duties due to failure to lead the club into the Total Caf Champions League Group Stage. Pure Platinum were eliminated 5-1 on aggregate by Angolan side Clube de Agosto, who beat them 3-0 in the first leg in Luanda before posting a 2-1 at Mandava Stadium in the return leg of the preliminary round. “FC Platinum notes with concern false reports circulating in the media to the effect that Norman Mapeza, who is the FC Platinum head coach, had resigned. FC Platinum wishes to advise the public that Mapeza is on sick leave. It is our hope that he will return to work fully recovered as we prepare to defend our historic Premier Soccer League title in the 2018 football season. As FC Platinum our employees’ health and safety remains a top priority and we pledge to give Mapeza all the necessary support to ensure that he quickly recovers. “Meanwhile, Sweswe will act as the head coach in his absence,” said the FC Platinum president George Mawere, who also expressed his regret at the unnecessary alarm that the false news might have caused to Mapeza’s family. Sweswe, who joined the platinum miners from Tsholotsho at the end of 2016 season, will be assisted by Patrick Mandizha and Daniel Vheremu. — @skhumoyo2000.
