Takudzwa Chitsiga, Harare Bureau Herentals 1 – 0 Triangle HERENTALS remembered how to win when they edged struggling Triangle in a Castle Lager Premiership game at the National Sports Stadium yesterday. The students were coming from back-to-back draws against Rhinos and Mutare City Rovers. Triangle have been struggling of late after a bright start. Herentals coach Kumbirai Mutiwekuziva said he was a relieved man after the victory. “I am very happy with this win, it was high time we collected maximum points,’’ said Mutiwekuziva. ‘’The guys now have self-belief and l think they will do well in our coming games. We look forward to our next matches and I think the win will help us in a big way, it’s a good thing to win against a seasoned team who are under a good coach.’’ Triangle coach Taurai Mangwiro said they were conceding goals they could avoid. “It is very unfortunate that we have conceded another spot kick which cost us three points. We were expecting to press but had a decision go against us and this demoralised us,’’ he said. Teams Herentals: F. Kuchineyi, B. Maunganidze, C.Mavhurume, P. Chaota, W. Chimbetu, W. Kapumha, I.
