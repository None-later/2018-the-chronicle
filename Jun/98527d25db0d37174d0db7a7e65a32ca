 Sylvester Chiramba, Court Reporter A security guard from Bulawayo has appeared in court for allegedly possessing more than 47 kg of dagga with an estimated street value amounting to $47 800. Clever Jaricha (52) from Nkulumane suburb was raided and found in possession of the dagga by police officers last week on Friday. The police raided his house following a tip-off and recovered the drugs. Jaricha appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Stephen Ndhlovu facing possession of dagga charges. He pleaded not guilty to the charge and Mr Ndhlovu remanded him in custody to July 6. Jaricha told the court that he did not know the contents of the bag in which the mbanje was found until the time of arrest. “I had no idea what was inside, I thought it was a bale of clothes because my nephew just left it in my custody and went away,” said Jaricha. Prosecuting, Ms Margaret Takawira told the court that on Friday last week police received a tip-off that Jaricha was in possession of dagga at his place of residence. “Acting on this information police officers proceeded to Jaricha’s place of residence where they conducted a search in his room,” said Ms Takawira “The police officers recovered a black bag which had 19 plastic paper bags of dagga.” The court heard that the dagga weighed 47,87 kg and has a street value of $47 800. @SlyCee10
