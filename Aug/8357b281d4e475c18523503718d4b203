 Michelle Gwizi, Chronicle Reporter A SPORTS bar in Bulawayo lost beer worth $18 after a patron faked an EcoCash message as proof of payment. Last Saturday, Thembelani Nxumalo (33) approached Ms Unity Muleya at Libra Fox Sports Bar at 31 Lemon groove road, Newton West and bought beer for $18 using an edited EcoCash message for transaction confirmation. A court heard Ms Muleya’s mobile phone had run out of power and Nxumalo took advantage by editing an existing message on his phone. He showed the message to Ms Muleya who believed he had made a transaction and gave him beer. Bulawayo Magistrate Ms Sithembiso Ndlovu sentenced Nxumalo to three months imprisonment wholly suspended on condition that he restitutes Ms Muleya. Prosecuting, Mr McLean Ndlovu said “Nxumalo bought beer using EcoCash.  He was given the EcoCash number to send money to, he edited the original message and presented a fake message to Ms Muleya to confirm payment,” he said. “Ms Muleya’s phone was off when Nxumalo was transacting the money so she relied on the message she was shown.” “She got to discover that she was tricked when   she switched on her phone to find that there was no money transferred to her by Nxumalo,” said Mr Ndlovu. The court heard that she reported the case to the police leading to Nxumalo’s arrest. The total amount lost was $18 and nothing was recovered. Bulawayo police spokesperson Chief Inspector Precious Simango last year urged the public to meticulously verify the time of transactions so they may not fall victim to the fraudsters. — @gwizi_n.
