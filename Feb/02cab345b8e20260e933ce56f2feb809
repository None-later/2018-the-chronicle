Lovemore Zigara in Gweru PREMIERSHIP newcomers Nichrut will finalise their squad on Monday ahead of the Castle Lager premiership season which is set to roar into life on March 10. The Shurugwi-based outfit who won the Zifa Central Region Soccer League’s sole promotional ticket into the topflight league, face Triangle today at Gibbo Stadium in the Lowveld as part of preparations for the new season. Former Chapungu gaffer John Nyikadzino who is Nichrut’s head coach, expressed satisfaction with his preparations for the season and said he is now ready to finalise his squad ahead of the new season. “I am happy with the way preparations have gone so far and we are now winding up preparations. We are playing Triangle tomorrow (today) and after that we will finalise our squad for the season,” said Nyikadzino. He said he was not going to be make wholesome changes to the squad that did duty in Division One last season but will just beef-up areas that need attention. There hasn’t been any big name signings at Nichrut except for Tonisani Sibelo who was playing in the topflight league. The Midlanders however largely used players with Premiership experience in their campaign last season. Other players who had set their sights at joining Nichrut such as Stephen Alimenda opted to join CSL side Sheasham, whose financial muscle has also attracted other premiership players such as former Shabanie Mine goalkeeper Victor Twaliki. Nichrut has however, lost the services of its top scorer last season Jacob Muzokomba together with Bastos Chihowa who have joined Gweru based military outfit, Chapungu. Players with premiership experience such as former Hwange duo of Farai Vimisai and David Boriwondo, Vimbai Madamombe and former Caps United left back Asani Nhongo form the backbone of the team. — @lavuzigara1 clred
