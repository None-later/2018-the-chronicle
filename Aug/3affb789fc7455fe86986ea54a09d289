 Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls ORGANISERS of the revitalised Victoria Falls International Jazz Festival have postponed the event by a month. The three-day jazz festival was meant to begin on September 7 through to September 9 at different venues across town with Zambezi House the main centre of attraction. Festival coordinator, Clayton Mugabe said they moved the event to October 19 to 21 so as to rope in more artistes. Venues are not changed. However, music lovers should not despair as the town continues to attract world class artistes with South African legend PJ Powers set to play for charity at Elephant Hills Hotel on September 8. In terms of the jazz festival which will have South African music icon, Yvonne Chaka Chaka as a guest as well as honour greats like Dorothy Masuka (84), Mugabe said the postponement is to allow time to rope in more artistes.â€”@ncubeleon
