Winky D Kiyapili Sibanda, Showbiz Reporter Students from the Great Zimbabwe University will tonight have a rare opportunity to witness Winky D perform live during the NetOne OneFusion Campus Concert. The concert taking place at Caravan Park will also feature performances from Judgement Yard, Jah Signal and Ras Caleb among many others. NetOne marketing and public relations executive Eldrette Shereni said hosting the campus concerts was a way of appreciating their young customers and encouraging them to buy the OneFusion package. “The Campus Party is our way of appreciating our young customers by allowing them to have a party on our tab by simply buying OneFusion $3 and OneFusion $5 as their tickets into the concert. “So, essentially, they get to enjoy performances by Winky D, Judgement Yard, Jah Signal as well as their OneFusion package and get exclusive access to this jam packed OneFusion party,” Shereni said. Last month, NetOne held similar OneFusion campus parties for Chinhoyi University of Technology and Midlands State University students. Shereni said they were glad to do the same for Masvingo to accord students from GZU, Masvingo Poly, MSU Zvishavane Campus, Morgenster Teachers’ College, Bondolfi Teachers’ College and Reformed Church Zimbabwe University a chance to join in the fun. – @Kiyaz_Cool
