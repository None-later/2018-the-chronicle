Mzoe 7 Langalakhe Mabena LOCAL kwaito artiste Mzoe 7 (real name Mzobanzi Mlauzi) successfully launched his Ulimenemene national tour last Saturday at Club 09 in Bulawayo. The tour saw Mzoe 7 launching a new Gqom single titled Ulimenemene, a song which has won the title of the tour courtesy of its fast penetration and reception by his local fans. His partner in production and hit making DJ Skaiva also exercised his skills on the decks with different up-and-coming artistes who included Dwizzy Boi Wonder, Sweeto, and TRP to mention a few, also getting a chance to perform and gain exposure. The Entumbane-bred musician-cum-television-presenter, who strongly believes the new single will be a national anthem soon, revealed that he decided to take his music and creativity outside the city so he can attract more fans and have relevance nationwide. “Before I officially dropped the single, I took it to Skyz Metro FM as a way of experimenting and I’m encouraged as it’s already battling with the city’s top songs on Skyz Metro’s Top 20 countdown show. That’s a sign that people love the song because for it to be in the top 20, fans have to vote for it,” said Mzoe 7. He added: “I’ve done shows in the city and I appreciate the love I receive from my fans, but now, it’s that moment in my career where I need to take my music outside Bulawayo so more people know who Mzoe 7 is and get to appreciate my music. This is the reason why I embarked on the national tour.” As the tour was successfully launched in his mother city, the next gig will be held on July 7 at BBQ Gardens in Gwanda where Mzoe 7 will perform alongside Gwanda’s finest kwaito group Zhezhingtons and Badhila. Other venues and dates are yet to be set. – @langamabena
