 Taurai Mangudhla, Harare Bureau Zimbabwe is pushing for additional spectrum to support growth for its broadcast and information communication technology (ICT) industry, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Information Communication Technology and Cyber Security, Engineer Sam Kundishora has said. Additional spectrum provides Zimbabwe and Africa with business opportunities and employment, Engineer Kundishora told our sister paper, The Herald Business on the side-lines of the ongoing four-day second meetings of the African Telecommunications Union (ATU) World Radio Conference (WRC) 19 preparatory working groups. Engineer Kundishora said there is consensus among African nations on the need for increased spectrum. The ongoing meeting, hosted by Potraz, comes ahead of a crucial WRC to be hosted for the first time in Africa by Egypt in November 2019. The WRC is held once every three to four years and brings together regulators, suppliers, broadcasters and mobile network operators (MNOs). “Spectrum is a finite resource and we have to fight now. Right now we are opening community radio stations broadcasting in local languages of the communities and they need frequencies,” he said. “In the event our allocations increase, business scores big because those  who operate stations will get money, those who manufacture and supply equipment also get business in a multi-billion dollar industry,” added Engineer Kundishora. He said countries also need support to ensure they are not bombarded by broadcasters outside their borders at the expense of their own stations.
