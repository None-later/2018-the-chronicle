Thandeka Moyo, Chronicle Reporter A 76-YEAR-OLD woman from Bulawayo has said 23 is too big a number for people contesting in the presidential election in Zimbabwe and shows that politicians no longer have people’s interests at heart. Ms Getrude Dlamini, a registered voter who has been passionate about politics since childhood, said some of the candidates should have at least forged alliances to reduce the number of presidential candidates. Speaking during the launch of the Afro Barometer survey in Bulawayo on Monday, Ms Dlamini said vote buying, which was unheard of in the past, is also characterising this year’s harmonised polls. “I long for the olden days when politics was all about development and serving people not this circus that we have been subjected to. Honestly I think Zimbabwe is too small to have 23 presidential candidates and it shows our people are divided,” she said. According to Ms Dlamini, some of today’s politicians are more worried about amassing wealth and supporting their own ethnic groups. “The reason why we are so divided with 23 wannabe presidents is because people have forgotten what leadership entails. I wish these youngsters would unite and have minimal parties so that there is development in Zimbabwe because this country has been getting worse with each year,” she said. Ms Dlamini bemoaned lack of political education among youths saying it may blur their vision when voting. “I hope that come Monday next week people will be well informed about what entails a good leader. We are tired of people who divide and then try to convince us to put them into power,” she said. Politicians should, according to Ms Dlamini, unite in addressing current challenges like unemployment and poverty for the benefit of every Zimbabwean despite cultural differences. Mr Mloyiswayizizwe Gumede, who was also in attendance, said the upcoming polls are bound to be different. @thamamoe
