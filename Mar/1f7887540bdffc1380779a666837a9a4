Joey Antipas Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter Chicken Inn 2-1 Mutare City CHICKEN INN bounced back to winning ways after edging Premiership returnees Mutare City 2-1 at Luveve Stadium yesterday. Darryl Nyandoro rose from the bench in the 45th  minute to score a second half brace that gave the home side  the three valuable points, condemning Mutare City to their third loss. Nyandoro opened the scoring with a powerful header  ten minutes after coming on when he connected with a well taken George Majika cross on the left. He sealed his brace 12 minutes later with a low shot from inside the box with ageless Clemence Matawu the provider this time around. The veteran midfielder danced his way into the visitors’ box before setting up Nyandoro. Billy Veremu scored the visitors’ consolation in the 84th minute, when he capitalised on a lapse of concentration  at the back from the GameCocks. A relieved  Joey Antipas said  it was an important victory for his side. “The introduction of Nyandoro  saw us going forward and we managed to get the two goals. We are still work in progress and we are happy with the progression so far,” said Antipas His opposite number Joseph Takaringofa was disappointed with the result but hailed his side’s fighting spirit. “A draw would have been a good result for us but things did not go our way. Our aim remains to fight relegation hopefully we start getting results soon,” said Takaringofa. Teams Chicken Inn: E.Chipezeze, P.Bernard, D.Lunga, K.Chideu, M.Moses, S.Munawa, W.Kamudyariwa, C.
