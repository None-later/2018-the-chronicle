 Sukoluhle Ndlovu, Midlands Correspondent A BEVY of 15 beauties will tonight take to the ramp in the Miss Gweru pageant taking place at the Cathedral Hall. Event organiser, Image Modelling founder, Mavis Koslek, said all was in place. She said the main mission of the pageant, other than just entertainment, was to empower the girl child. “Our aim is to empower the girl child. The pageant will give the models a voice to deal with issues pertaining to abuse in societies where they come from,” Koslek said. Entertainment will be provided by Legion, Xiddo, Yulesiis, DJ Mupsy and DJ Masty. Last year, 20-year-old Michelle Tugwete, a photographer, was crowned Miss Gweru while Takudzwa Phiri (17), a hairdresser, was crowned first princess. Kgotso Mhandu – a Lower Six student, was second princess. For her efforts, Tugwete walked away with a fully serviced residential stand courtesy of River Valley properties and a 32 inch flat screen TV set. Koslek thanked the Gweru community for the support they had given the pageant over the years. “The support we’ve been getting from the Gweru community, especially businesses, has been overwhelming. I can safely say the event has been getting better and bigger with each passing year,” she said.
