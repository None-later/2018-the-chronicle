 Yemurai Ushamba, Chronicle Reporter A BULAWAYO man has told the court that he is seeking paternity tests for his second child with his ex-wife as she told him that she was pregnant months after they had separated. Yolanda Ndlovu was seeking an upward variation from Deniah Madondo to include their second child in the maintenance order when he said he was not the child’s father. Madondo was ordered to pay $60 for the upkeep of their first child only and now the ex-wife is seeking that he also pays for the upkeep of their second child. “I want him to support our second child. He has never supported me ever since I was pregnant saying the child is not his. I am seeking an upward variation from $60 to $120 to include our second child in the order,” she said. Madondo denied paternity of the child. “I am not the father of her second child. We separated and it’s been long since we have been together. The time she told me that she was pregnant, we had already separated. When we last came to court she told me she will not work but will depend on the money for maintenance. It’s difficult for me to make an offer because I am not employed. I would rather seek paternity tests first,” he said. Bulawayo magistrate Mr Usheunesu Matova said Madondo must prove scientifically that he was not the father. “If you cannot make an offer, the court will simply impose an order on you. You will pay $30 interim maintenance until both parties go for paternity tests,” he said. — @YUshamba
