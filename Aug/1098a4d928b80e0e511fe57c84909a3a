Zimbabwe arrived in Mozambique yesterday ahead of today’s match organised by the hosts as part of celebrations on the inauguration of a new stadium, Estadio Municipal De Beira. “We have already talked with the players on the objectives of the game and psyching those who will get their first caps. “The first time is always a challenge yes, but we won’t put them under pressure. “We always play to win and they should always adopt a winning mentality. But we are not under pressure,” said Sibanda. The Cosafa Championships will take place from September 12 to 23 in South and Zimbabwe will be among the favourites for the regional title. “As always when we get time to go out and play, its every coach’s dream to do well,’’ said Sibanda. ‘’I think we had a great outing last year, we want to carry on from there. “It’s only that we have not yet started preparations for Cosafa but we will see where our preparations will take us. “Obviously we want to do well, we want to do better,” Sibanda said.
