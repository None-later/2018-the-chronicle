 In today’s edition of The Chronicle, in a story entitled, ‘Zec to monitor media coverage’, we erroneously quoted The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Media, Information and Broadcasting Services, Mr George Charamba as having said he would invite the Minister of Justice to their offices so that they can read the submissions in AIPPA as well as BSA together to ascertain if they have any issues that they have raised. Mr Charamba actually said they intend to invite MISA not the Minister of Justice. Any inconvenience caused to Mr Charamba and the Minister is sincerely regretted – Editor.
