Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter LUPANE State University will today hold its annual fundraising golf tournament at Harry Allen Golf Club in Bulawayo whose proceeds are to go towards the construction of a clinic at the institution’s main campus in Lupane. A number of dignitaries from the education, public and private sectors are expected to tee off for the cause in the four-ball better ball anonymous format. In this format, golfers tee off in groups of four (either as one four-person team or as two, two-person teams), and each golfer plays his own ball. So there are four balls in play on each hole, but only one ball (the better ball, or low ball) counts per team per hole. If four-person teams are in use, then all four golfers tee off and play their own balls into the hole. The low score among the four counts as the team score for that hole. If two-person teams are in use, then Team One and Team Two tee off together (so four balls are still in play), and each team’s low ball counts as that team’s score on each hole. With two-person teams, 4BBB can be played as stroke play or match play. “The importance of equipping a health care facility at the University Campus cannot be over emphasised so that our key stakeholders, the students, have a memorable and quality learning experience in their university of choice,” said the LSU Vice Chancellor, Pardon Kuipa in a communiqué. He said the health of the students and staff was of paramount importance hence the need to have the clinic within the institution. “Health services in Lupane are far from the university with St Luke’s Hospital located 30KM away while the local clinic is always overwhelmed. The availability of such a health facility will go a long way in alleviating this challenge and the internal stakeholders will also be assured of convenient medical attention all the time,” said Vice Chancellor Kuipa. Participation fees have been pegged at $20 per player. — @skhumoyo2000.
