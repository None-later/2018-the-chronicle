Sikhumbuzo MoyoSenior,  Sports Reporter THE recently formed Rainbow Amateur Netball Association disbursed $5 000 to each region to run Independence tournaments. The latest windfall comes barely a month after a hugely successful tournament held at White City Stadium that brought 21 netball teams from across the country. Each participating team received $500 from sponsors Glow Petroleum, while the winning team Platinum Queens, who beat fellow Midlands side Glow Petroleum 21-19, got $1 000. The losing finalists pocketed $900 and third-placed Hwange got $800, while ZRP Bulawayo received $700 for their fourth place finish. “Our regions have been given $5 000 each to hold Independence tournaments. Bulawayo and Matabeleland South have been combined into one region because of few teams from Matabeleland South, while Matabeleland North and Central Region will stand alone,” said Precious Mudenge, deputy secretary general of the Rainbow Amateur Netball Association. She said Matabeleland North has 10 teams and will hold its tournament in Lupane, while Sobukhazi High School will host teams from Bulawayo and Matabeleland South, with the finals set for White City Stadium on Independence Day. “Central Region teams will be 16 and their gala will be held at the Midlands State University on Independence Day. For now all the regions are busy making final preparations and we are grateful to the sponsors for recognising the girl child in this manner,” said Mudenge. The Rainbow Amateur Netball Association is, however, still battling to be recognised by the Zimbabwe Netball Association and the matter has since spilled into the courts.
