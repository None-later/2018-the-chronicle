BULAWAYO Mayor Councillor Solomon Mguni has encouraged people to share with the less privileged this Christmas to bring joy to everyone in the city. Speaking at the distribution of the Mayor’s Christmas Cheer Fund groceries donated by Asphalt Civil Engineering Contractors at Sidojiwe flats yesterday, Clr Mguni said Christmas is meant to share and bring happiness to everyone despite their earnings and social status. “As the city of Bulawayo, we want to celebrate Christmas as a family. Those who earn something should share with the less privileged so that we create a joyful and cheerful mood in the whole city.Whatever little you have, desire to share with your neighbour who has none,” he said. The mayor said the corporate world should donate to homes for the less privileged as that builds a strong bond between industry and the community. “We want to commend Asphalt Civil Engineering Contractors for sharing with the community. Other companies should also join hands in helping the needy. We understand the economy is not friendly and many companies are failing to withstand the situation but this company still stands. Since 1996, their contribution to the city has been significant and they have a strong relationship with Bulawayo South residents,” he said. Asphalt Civil Engineering Contractors Managing Director Mr Francis Mangwendeza said as part of its corporate social responsibility, the company donates to less privileged people including old people, orphans and those living with disabilities. “We are partnering with the mayor to bring smiles to the less privileged people here whom we know that with the price hikes, they may not afford buying groceries. We believe that Christmas is for everyone and they should be given a chance to enjoy like others,” he said. —@tamary98.
