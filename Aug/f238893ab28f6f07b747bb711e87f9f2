David Amm shows off his trophy Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Acting Sports Editor US-bound up and coming David Amm underlined his growing status when he won the 2018 Zimbabwe Amateur Golf Championship that ended on Tuesday at the Chapman Golf Club in Harare. The three-day tournament, running under the auspices of the Zimbabwe Golf Association, attracted 26 amateur golfers from across the country but it was Amm who emerged the best after carding a gross total of 281 for a 13 stroke win over second placed Tafadzwa Nyamukondiwa who grossed 294. Handicapped at minus two, Amm carded 72 on round one for a net total of 74 and on round two he carded 65 for a net of 67 while round three saw him carding 73 to net 75 before ending with a net of 73 after carding 71 on his fourth round. Coming third was Tafara Mpofu, with zero handicap, who was three strokes behind Nyamukondiwa whose handicap is one. Stuart Krog was fourth with a gross total of 298, a stroke behind Mpofu. On fifth position was Jack Allard who also grossed 298 while Tatenda Makunde came sixth with a gross total of 300. However with Amm set to leave for the United States next week on a four year scholarship, the victory will come as a befitting send off for the 2017 All Africa Golf tournament Zimbabwean team captain.
