Siyabonga Radebe Seasoned actor, Siyabonga Radebe is set to shift gears and play cupid and host on a brand new match-making TV show. With the launch of 1Magic happening at the end of this month, Siya will host an all new dating reality show called Kheth’Omthando. The show will see a bachelor or bachelorette matched up with four potential baes who will have to jump through different hoops before they can bag a date and possibly land the love of their lives. Unlike most dating reality TV show, in Kheth’Omthando contestants will actually have to prove how serious they are by going through several challenges. The suitor will be put to the test by their potential love interest, family and their friends. In the first challenge, all four potential baes will go through a questioning session by a panel that includes the love interest – whom they won’t know – and must prove why they could be the best “Ms/Mr” Right for the seeker. In the end, one suitor will be eliminated based on this interrogation, leaving three to battle it out for the affection of their potential bae. The next segment will be a really tough one – trying to impress and convince a family member that they are ‘The One’ who can take care of their precious loved one’s heart. The challenge will be anything from physical agility to emotional intelligence, so the suitor will have to bring their A-Game along. Only two admirers will be left standing after this grueling round. Based on what the bachelors/bachelorettes have learned about their potential love interest, they will have to come up with a date to top all dates.—Daily Sun.
