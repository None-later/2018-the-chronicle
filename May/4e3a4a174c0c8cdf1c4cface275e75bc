Tendai Chikuni Lovemore Zigara in Gweru AIRMEN Chapungu are likely to field a new look side against Dynamos in this afternoon’s Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Ascot Stadium in Gweru. Chapungu coach Tendai Chikuni, who watched his charges being punished 1–3 by Triangle on Sunday, blamed his defenders for making “silly mistakes”. Chikuni declared that he would be making wholesome changes for today’s encounter. “When you lose games, you need to change your tactics and the way you do things,” said Chikuni. Chapungu were humbled 0-4 by a Joel Christian Epoupa inspired DeMbare in a match that ended prematurely in 56th minute after Chapungu’s goal minder collapsed the goalposts in last season’s encounter at the same venue. The match subsequently resumed from the 56th minute on another day and Dynamos went on to collect maximum points. Dynamos were in terrific form last season, but circumstances are different this year, with both teams struggling. The two teams are separated by just two points and languishing at the tail-end of the league table. The airmen have managed eight points in as many games, while DeMbare, who collected their first set of maximum points on Sunday following a 2-1 win over Bulawayo City, are fourth from the bottom with just six points. With no Epoupa, who wants out of Dynamos, the Glamour Boys will have to look for another hero to turn on the magic today and give coach Lloyd Mutasa another lifeline after the Dynamos executive gave him a three-match ultimatum to get nine points. Chikuni is also under pressure to steer his side towards the safety zone. — @lavuzigara1.
