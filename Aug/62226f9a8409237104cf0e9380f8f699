 Melissa Mpofu in Harare After a hectic week of elections, the people of Harare – who were affected by an MDC Alliance protest on Wednesday – had something to smile about when Koffi Olomide performed here on Saturday evening. Initially, the show at the Harare International Conference Centre was billed to take place on Friday but after the unrest that claimed six lives, it had to be postponed to Saturday. Good move it was because on Friday evening, there was not much activity in the capital as people preferred to be indoors. So tense was the situation that one would swear they were not in the city that never sleeps. And when Saturday came, people seemed to have been assured that there would no longer be violence in the city so they came out to party. The event, for some served as an election victory party for President Mnangagwa. Others were simply rhumba fanatics. While it failed to attract a full house, the show organised by businessman Genius ‘Ginimbi’ Kadungure’s ‘ex-girlfriend’, Zodwa Mnkandla was a high energy one. For the better part of the night, people were on their feet, singing and dancing to hits from the local musicians. From Alick Macheso and Leonard Zhakata to Sulumani Chimbetu and Winky D, music fans got real value for their money as the artistes delivered and seemed to complement each other well. And after 1AM, although most people seemed weary then, Koffi Olomide’s band took to the stage. When the main man joined them, the crowd was overjoyed. Never one to disappoint, the Congolese singer with several gold records in his career wowed the audience with his Soukus dance moves. His dancers, although some felt were rather too old for the trade also put up a spirited performance. Speaking after his performance, Koffi who agreed to extend his stay in Zimbabwe by a day for no extra charge said he was glad everything went well. Many thought Koffi would not agree to perform after violence erupted in Harare but he insisted he would perform.
