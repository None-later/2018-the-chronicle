Nqobile Tshili, Showbiz Correspondent HARVEST House International (HHI) will today hold a pre-Easter concert that will be headlined by South Africa’s Joyous Celebration artiste Sibusiso Desmond “SbuNoah” Mthembu at its headquarters in Bulawayo. The concert will also feature performances by several local gospel artists including Gospel Unplugged, One Spirit, Vocal Ex and Lorraine Maplanka-Stot among others. HHI Senior Pastor Leo Mupezani said the concert will be a precursor of the church’s new hub launch tomorrow. The Church’s vision is to set up 1 000 branches by 2020 under the banner of HHI in order to bring evangelism gospel closer to the people. “We’ve invited Joyous Celebration’s Sbu Noah to headline the concert which will take place on Saturday starting at 4PM ending at 7PM at our headquarters situated along George Silundika Street and 13th Avenue,” said Snr Pastor Mupezani. “The concert is meant to market the new hub. We’re saying to Bulawayo residents, come let’s celebrate Easter. We know that when we approach holidays, many people plan parties and things like that but we’re saying come let’s celebrate Jesus under one roof.” Snr Pastor Mupezeni said the new hub will be launched by HHI founder, Bishop Collin Nyathi, as part of his vision for the church to have 1 000 branches by 2020. The church, he said, already boasts 473 branches globally. Snr Pastor Mupezeni said the hubs are meant to bring the church closer to the communities hence the church’s plans to open as many new branches as possible. — @nqotshili
