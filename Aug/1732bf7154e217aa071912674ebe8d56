Tirivashe Nheweyembwa Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Acting Sports Editor NO decision has been reached on when this year’s Zimbabwe National Youth and Paralympic Games set for the Midlands will be held following the outbreak of typhoid in Gweru that has so far claimed five lives. They have however, been postponed and the organisers will come up with new dates during the course of the week.
