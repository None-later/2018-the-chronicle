 Codelia Mondela, Court Reporter A BULAWAYO woman’s dream revealed the rape of her 12-year-old daughter last year by her neigbour’s HIV positive gardener. The 38-year old rapist was yesterday convicted of one count of rape and sentenced to 16 years imprisonment by Bulawayo regional magistrate Mrs Sibongile Msipa-Marondedze. He had pleaded not guilty. The woman, whose name cannot be revealed to protect the complainant, quizzed her daughter after the dream and she confessed being raped. The gardener raped the minor last year when she visited his workplace for revision studies with his employer. The matter came to light last month when the girl’s mother dreamt of her being raped. In passing sentence, Mrs Msipa-Marondedze said the man’s actions were barbaric and he deserved to be locked away for a long time as he was a danger to society. “You raped the minor without using protection knowing that you are HIV positive. You are a heartless and selfish person who does not deserve any pity from the court,” she said. @MondelaC
