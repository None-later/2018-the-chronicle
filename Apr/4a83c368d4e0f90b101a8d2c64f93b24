Leonard Ncube,  Sports Reporter NTABAZINDUNA from Umguza District edged Lusumbami of Hwange 14-13 to lift the Matabeleland North Independence Day netball tournament at Somhlolo Stadium in Lupane on Wednesday. The tournament was part of the newly formed Rainbow Amateur Netball League (RNL)’s initiative to equally fund the game across the country after disbursing $5 000 from the Glow Petroleum sponsorship to each of its five regions for the event. Ntabazinduna pocketed $400 in prize money in addition to a trophy and medals for emerging tops in the seven-team tournament, while Lusumbami took home $300. Each of the seven Matabeleland North districts was supposed to come up with a team for the event, Binga, Bubi and Nkayi teams failed to travel. RNL Matabeleland North chairperson, Linah Mpala, said she was impressed by talent the community teams displayed. “We had seven teams, three from Lupane, two from Hwange, while Tsholotsho and Umguza had a one each. We love netball and we thought that while things are being worked out for the league, we play at community level,” said Mpala. “We sought sponsorship from Glow Petroleum, who poured in $5 000 to celebrate Independence Day. We realised that we always had football matches during such days and decided to add netball this year.” Mpala said the province was endowed with talent which needs to be identified and nurtured and appealed to the business community from the province to help develop the sport. — @ncubeleon.
