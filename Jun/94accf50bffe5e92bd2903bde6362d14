 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO provincial baseball team vice captain Eldon Mudzingwa is convinced his side can beat Harare province when the two clash in a three-match series that begins at Hamilton High School tomorrow. The series is set to produce explosive baseball action and fans are therefore guaranteed a treat. It will be the fourth series this year with Bulawayo leading 2-1. “We are certainly looking forward to the series. Morale in camp is very high. I believe the boys are ready for the challenge ahead. It is going to be tough but we have to rise up to the challenge if we are to win the series. We are going to be playing at home so we hope to use that to our advantage. We want fans to come in their numbers and support the team,” said Mudzingwa. Japanese coach Naoki Taniyama is working with the Bulawayo team in what should be a lift for the home squad. The hosts will pin their hopes of a series victory on the likes of national team players Shepherd Sibanda, Hloniphani Ngulube and Brandon Majobo. Entry into the venue will be free with fans guaranteed lots of fun in the form of jumping castles for children and a braai.
