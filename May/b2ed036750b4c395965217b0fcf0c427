Dani Alves BRAZIL right-back Dani Alves will miss this summer’s World Cup with a knee injury. The 35-year-old damaged the cruciate ligament in his right knee in PSG’s French Cup final win this week. It was hoped he would recover in time for the tournament in Russia but the Brazilian federation said yesterday that it was “impossible.” The former Barcelona and Juventus defender has won 106 caps and played in the 2010 and 2014 World Cups. Five-time winners Brazil will face Switzerland, Costa Rica and Serbia in Group E. — SuperSport
