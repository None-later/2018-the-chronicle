Mr Tendai Biti Crime Reporter MDC Alliance principal, Tendai Biti earlier today evaded arrest at the Zimbabwe-Zambia border while fleeing the country to seek asylum in that neighbouring country. Biti was briefly detained at Chirundu Border Post and was supposed to be transported back to Harare to assist with investigations for inciting post-election violence.
