 Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Bubi District team goes into camp tomorrow at Somvubu High School in preparation for the forthcoming Matabeleland North National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) inter-district track and field athletics competition set for Tsholotsho next week. Seven districts from the province will fight for the crown at Tsholotsho and Mavela High School on March 8-9 and to prepare a strong challenge, Bubi district announced a 68-member squad that will be drilled for the meet. “The district team meets this Friday (tomorrow) at Somvubu High, as we fine tune our squad ahead of the provincial finals. As previously said by the district head-in-charge of athletics, we did have a meeting on Monday where the coaches presented their budget and other technical needs for the camp and competition,” said the Nash district chairperson, Khumbulani Sibanda, the headmaster of Somvubu High School. The team was selected during an inter-schools meet held at Siganda High School last week and won by Inyathi High followed by Somvubu and Majiji. It was therefore no surprise that the three schools provided the largest number of athletes to the district team. At the provincial finals, Bubi will square up against athletes from Hwange, Lupane, Nkayi, Umguza, Binga and hosts Tsholotsho and a provincial team will be selected for the national finals later this month.
