John Nyikadzino Lovemore Zigara in Gweru SHURUGWI-based outfit Nichrut return to Ascot Stadium this afternoon seeking their first win at the venue this season when they face winless ZPC Kariba in a Castle Lager premiership encounter. The premiership new boys had a perfect start to the season where they won their opening match of the season against Mutare City before drawing their next two games. However, Mushonga Unouraya Ipapoipapo’s bubble burst when they went down 1 – 0 to log leaders Ngezi Platinum before falling by the same margin at the hands of Highlanders at Barbourfields last weekend. The league debutants will be looking for a positive result at all costs to ensure they remain safe from the murky waters of relegation as they have been touted among the candidates for the dreaded chop. Their coach, John Nyikadzino, believes today’s encounter is an opportunity to atone for the last two defeats and give something to smile about for their legion of supporters. “Every game is different altogether and today’s encounter is one we should use to collect maximum points. We cannot afford to drop points especially when you are playing at home when your fans are rallying behind us,” he said. “We did not win in our last two games and we need to gain our confidence back through a win. However, we are not underrating our opponents as they are a good side who have quality in their side but we are ready for the challenge,” added Nyikadzino. However, ZPC Kariba will be hoping to kick start their campaign after collecting a point in their opening five games of the season being the 0 – 0 draw against equally struggling Dynamos. The power generators lost to FC Platinum on a technicality after failing to turn up for a scheduled fixture before Black Rhinos, Herentals and Triangle United piled more misery on the Godfrey Tamirepi coached side.-@lavuzigara1
