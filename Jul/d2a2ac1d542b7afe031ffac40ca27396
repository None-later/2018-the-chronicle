Dr Joice Mujuru Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent THE Dr Joice Mujuru-led People’s Rainbow Coalition (PRC) has commended the prevailing peaceful election environment saying it has created space for competing political parties to reach out to the electorate without any hindrances. The country will hold harmonised elections on July 30. The prevailing peaceful environment follows President Mnangagwa’s consistent calls for peace and tolerance ahead of the elections. In an interview, Dr Mujuru’s deputy in her National People’s Party Dr Samuel Sipepa Nkomo said despite the increase in contesting political parties and candidates, the environment has been very calm for parties and individuals to campaign. “If you compare to previous periods, the election now is very peaceful thereby allowing political parties to go about their business without disturbances. We meet with other contesting candidates in the streets and greet each other sometimes to an extent of exchanging our flyers. They give us theirs and we give them ours so that we have a look at what they are doing,” said Dr Sipepa Nkomo. “The electorate is also peaceful. I haven’t heard anything even in Bulawayo where there are many candidates contesting.” Dr Sipepa Nkomo said as many as 17 aspiring Members of Parliament were contesing in a constituency in Bulawayo but because of tolerance and political maturity, the campaigns were peaceful. He said the only disturbing development was that of individuals destroying other political parties’ campaign posters. Commenting on the media coverage, Dr Sipepa said the media seemed biased in favour of the MDC Alliance and Zanu-PF.-@nqotshili
