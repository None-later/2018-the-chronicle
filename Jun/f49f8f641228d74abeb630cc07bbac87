 Business Reporter THE National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) is set to take over the presidency of the Southern Africa Railways Association (Sara) at the association’s board meeting to be held in Harare today. NRZ general manager Engineer Lewis Mukwada is expected to be nominated as the Sara president taking over from Zambia Railways Limited chief executive officer Mr Christopher Musonda. “NRZ is this week hosting chief executives of railway companies in the Southern Africa region, at the 2018 first board meeting of the Sara,” public relations manager Mr Nyasha Maravanyika said. “Eng Mukwada is expected to be nominated as the Sara president.” The board meeting will be held at a Harare hotel. The Sara leadership is based on rotational selection of the association’s president and vice president on annual basis based on the criteria set in the Sara constitution. At present, the country’s rail giant was deputising the Zambia Railways Limited. The Beitbridge Bulawayo Railway (BBR) is also expected to ascend into the Sara presidium as deputy president. Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Dr Joram Gumbo would officially open the board meeting today. Sara has its headquarters in Harare and has three categories of members of the association. It was formed in April 1996 in line with the Sadc Protocol on Transport, Communications and Meteorology, Article 13.13, which stipulated the formation of regional associations for each transport mode.
