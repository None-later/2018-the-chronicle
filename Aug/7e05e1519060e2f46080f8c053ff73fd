Alick Macheso Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent SUNGURA ace Alick Macheso will be bringing his latest album Dzinosvitsa Kure to Bulawayo this Friday to afford fans in the city an opportunity to witness him perform the tracks live on stage. Macheso is billed to perform at Khumalo Hockey Stadium, his first show in the city this year. This will also be the first time he performs at an open space in Bulawayo since his favourite venue, the Amphitheatre, banned the hosting of musical concerts. Ever since this ban last year, it has proved difficult for Macheso and other artistes to stage shows in the city, something that has seen Bulawayo being starved of entertainment. Macheso will be supported by Clement Magwaza who is always up to the task. This will also be Magwaza’s opportunity to sample some tracks off his new album, Khala Uthethe. Last year, Magwaza shared the stage with Macheso and the two worked wonders at the Manor Hotel as it was a night to remember. Show promoter Assan Mandizvidza Mugumbate said the show was for Macheso and Magwaza fans. “It’ll be a show not to be missed especially for Macheso and Magwaza fans. The two artistes will perform songs from their new albums. We encourage their fans to come in numbers to watch the two artistes perform live,” said Mugumbate. Entrance to the show has been pegged at $5 with gates set to open at 6PM. Dzinosvitsa Kure, which was released in June this year, has been doing quite well. With songs such as Kudzwai, Chikuru Kurarama, Madzitete and Vane zvavanoda, the album has the social commentary lyrics that Macheso fans have fallen in love with.
