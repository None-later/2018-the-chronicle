Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter SURPRISE package in the race for the Southern Region Division One Soccer League championship Mosi Rovers remain modest with their coach Phumulo “Kanu” Mathe saying his side is fighting relegation from the top. The Victoria Falls based side are second on the table with 16 points after nine games and trail leaders Hwange by two points. Mosi Rovers are tied on points with former Premiership side Tsholotsho and they have defied the pre-season odds as they are above most teams that were tipped to lead the championship race. The pre-season title race favourites that are below Mosi are fifth placed Makomo and ZPC Hwange who are on position seven and are tied on 14 points. Heading into today’s game against Bosso 90, Mosi Rovers’ coach has predicted a tough encounter. “We are trying to run away from fighting relegation in the second half of the season when pressure becomes too much. This means that we have to make sure that we pick as many points as possible especially at home and try to grind results on the road to make sure we survive relegation. “Bosso 90 are coming to Victoria Falls on a high after beating Tsholotsho 2-1 last weekend which shows that they are not pushovers. We have to be at our best to get a positive result,” said Mathe. Last season Mosi Rovers surrendered a 2-0 lead taken within 20 minutes of the game as they allowed Bosso 90 to get back into the game and left Victoria Falls with three points as they won the encounter 3-2. Mosi Rovers will pin their hopes on veteran goalkeeper Joseph Guyumani, defending trio of Harrington Katsenyura, Definite Tsikwa and Lucas Sibanda as well as seasoned midfielder Blessing Sande, Trust Nkomazana and Ndabazabo Ndlovu. Thinkwell Weva and Nabboth Taverera will lead their strike force. Bosso 90 coach Melusi Sibanda who missed last weekend’s victory as he had travelled with Highlanders first team for the 2-1 away win against Harare City is back and will be assisted by Gift Lunga (junior) in Victoria Falls. “It’s a tricky game because Mosi Rovers have been doing well and it’s not by fluke that they are at the top. Last year we won there after a dramatic comeback but that’s all history and we have to work hard to ensure we return with maximum points,” Sibanda said. Former Young Warriors midfielder Denzel Khumalo who scored a brace against Tsholotsho, left winger Xolani Mdlongwa, ex-national under-20 defender Nkosana Ndlovu as well as goalkeeper Erick Phiri are expected to lead Bosso 90’s hunt for maximum points. Meanwhile, leaders Hwange are at home to CIWU with Toronto, the only team yet to win this season playing host to Indlovu Iyanyathela.
