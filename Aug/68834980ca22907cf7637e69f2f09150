 FORMER Springbok coach Peter de Villiers says World Rugby is not investing enough in the sport in Africa. The experienced De Villiers, who coached the Springboks from 2008-2011, told KweséESPN in Kampala that Africa continues to use the little resources it has to develop and improve rugby. “There is a lot of money there with World Rugby, but very little comes to Africa. They give very little to African nations and expect them to die on the field,” said the Sables coach, who guided Zimbabwe to a 38-18 victory over Uganda in the Africa Rugby Gold Cup last Saturday to avoid relegation to the Silver Cup. “World Rugby should invest more in Africa because there is abundant talent here. But we are working around very limited budgets and yet many others outside Africa are getting more support. “We are playing good (rugby) in Africa, entertaining the public and developing the sport. But I think World Rugby has to rethink their strategy and invest more in rugby in Africa.” De Villiers wondered why the poor are getting much less support from World Rugby: “We have continued to play rugby in Africa under tough conditions, but the numbers of people watching the game are growing and surely World Rugby has to find ways of adding more support.” Commenting on the win that had them finish fourth in the competition, the coach said it was all because of hard work that they picked up this vital away victory. “I cannot blame my players for the past games because I believe they still gave a lot and have steadily showed improvement. I will enjoy the victory over Uganda because I prepared the boys well for the game and they played according to plan.” Under De Villiers, who took charge early this year, Zimbabwe lost to Namibia, Tunisia and Kenya, while drawing with Morocco and defeating Uganda Rugby Cranes. Namibia qualified for the 2019 Rugby World Cup after completing the campaign unbeaten, while Kenya will play in the repechage competition. – Kwese.espn.com
