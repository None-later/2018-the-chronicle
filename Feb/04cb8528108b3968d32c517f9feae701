Joel Tsvakwi, Showbiz Correspondent Up-and-coming gospel artistes in Bulawayo are stepping up efforts to rebrand their industry and make themselves more visible. They have formed an organisation named Greater Trumpet Music Foundation (GTMF). The goal of the GTMF is to brand artistes so that they are able to produce quality music and be able to compete on the same footing with their counterparts in the secular world. Nodumo Hadebe, representing the foundation on the sidelines of a meeting to map the 2018 trajectory shared her organisation’s intentions. “GTMF has the potential to take Bulawayo gospel artists to a new level, both nationally and on the international space. “Bulawayo is going to come alive once again in their walk with God as gospel artists are planning to offer the best in gospel showbiz through the GTMF music,” Hadebe said. Asked how the foundation will come to the rescue of the up-and-coming gospel artists, she said they had lined up a plethora of mechanisms. “We are at an advanced stage of having a joint gospel gig at a venue to be announced soon in the city of Bulawayo. “Over and above that, we’ll help the artistes with their recordings and album launches among other things. “We realised that we’re family so we need to expose each other through live performances as by so doing, we’ll be grooming and training each other on our varying endowed abilities as artists.” Pastor Jedmos Moyo a senior member of the foundation said: “Gospel artists have been starved due to shortages of resources, so it’s our time to come together, get organised and support each other to spread the gospel.” “Our foundation is not limited to Bulawayo artistes only as we have members in all provinces and some in the diaspora. Any progressive gospel artist is free to join the foundation.” — @joelTsvakwi.
