UP-AND-COMING dancehall group, Masvingo Realness Entertainment wants to be a force to reckon with in the ancient city’s music industry which is literally dead due to lack of notable activity. The two-member ensemble comprised of Chibaba Teekay (real name Takunda Mupfuvi) and DJ C Rollz (Ronald Mapfuma) said it wants to take the province’s music to dizzy heights next year by releasing quality music. Chibaba Teekay said the support they have been getting from music lovers each time they have curtain raised for established artistes, was very encouraging. The 23-year-old artistes fuse Jamaican dancehall with Zimdancehall, also throwing in some gospel tunes. They started their musical journey in 2016 but were discouraged as they hardly got recognition. Teekay said things improved last year when they started getting invitations to perform at weddings and school events. He said demand for their performances got overwhelming as they would get bookings every month. He said promoters later started taking note of them and would include them as curtain raisers each time there were shows for established artistes like Winky D, Seh Calaz and Alick Macheso. “When we started in 2016, we were not recognised by promoters as well as established artistes. But now, we’re slowly becoming a force to reckon with in the arts industry in Masvingo and come 2019, we’re going to push to put our city’s music on the map,” said Teekay. He said they were now hard at work on their debut album which they hope to release next month. “We promise our fans that by January next year, we’d have released our six-track album. We’re infact polishing it up,” he said.
