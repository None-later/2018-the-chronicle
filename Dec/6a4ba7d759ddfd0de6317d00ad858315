AFTER a convincing display in two successive seasons on the domestic front, free scoring midfielder and Soccer Star of the Year Rodwell Chinyengetere says he is ready for a new challenge ahead of his move to South African Premiership football side Baroka FC. The 30-year-old’s departure to a foreign league comes hard on the heels of a trendsetting year where he joined the legendary trident of George “Mastermind” Shaya, Peter Ndlovu and the late Stanley “Sinyo” Ndunduma to win the Soccer Star of the Year award twice. Chinyengetere is expected to join the Pietersburg-based side in January, linking up with compatriots, in form goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze and exciting winger Talent Chawapiwa, who both did not take long to settle Down South. He waved a good bye to the Zvishavane-based side on Saturday after helping them to a maiden CAF Champions’ League group stages appearance. “FC Platinum has been my home and I just want to say thank you to the supporters and everyone associated with this club… I will greatly miss the good times we had here. “I think leaving them in the group stages is a big thank you, I cannot thank the club enough for what they have done to me but at least I am happy I have left them at the top of African football. I think football is just the same wherever you go and the only difference is the environment; and I think I will be able to do well in South Africa. I have been following football in their league and I think I have the capacity to topple the challenges that I am going to face,” said Chinyengetere.
