Impumelelo Shining Stars now known as Indosakusa, The Morning Star Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent IMBUBE ensemble Impumelelo Shining Stars have rebranded their name to “Indosakusa, The Morning Star”, a move they say was inspired by God. The group that was formed in 2001 in Mpopoma revealed this during an event to re-introduce themselves to the public at Hope Centre in Bulawayo last Friday. Oscar Siziba, the group’s leader, said the name change was similar to the Bible where Paul’s name was changed from Saul by God and Abram to Abraham. “We’re a prayerful group and after the prayer, God gave us this revelation that the group should change its name because he had a higher calling for us. After some meditation, we settled for the name Indosakusa, The Morning Star,” he said. Siziba said their mandate now was to carry the word of God through song and dance around the world. “The name means we’re the light and we’re carrying the word of God to the world. The revelation that God gave us isn’t something that just came now. It’s been there for years and we’ve been praying about it and waiting for the appointed time to change the name and this is the one,” he said. Siziba said they would launch an album soon under the new name. As Impumelelo Shining Stars, the group has nine albums. On the albums that were released under Impumelelo Shining Stars, Siziba said: “The albums that we released as Impumelelo Shining Stars won’t be affected by this change of names. People can still get those albums under the old name. “Very soon, we shall release a new album under the Indosakusa name and people will hear the new way we’re doing things under God’s mandate.”
