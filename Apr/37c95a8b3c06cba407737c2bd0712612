 Nyaradzo Bakari, Chronicle Reporter A HERDSMAN from Worringham on the outskirts of Bulawayo has appeared in court for allegedly raping a co-worker’s daughter. The girl, who cannot be named for ethical reasons, is an Early Childhood Development pupil. The man was not asked to plead to rape charges before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Franklin Mkhwananzi. The magistrate remanded him in custody to 20 April. Mr Mkhwananzi advised the suspect to apply for bail at the High Court. “You will come back to court on April 20. You will be in custody as it is not in my jurisdiction to grant you bail. So you can apply for bail at the High Court or seek consent from the National Prosecuting Authority,” he said. Prosecuting, Mr Maclean Ndlovu said the man raped the girl while her father had gone to search for goats last week Wednesday. He said the accused inserted his fingers into the girls’ privates before raping her once. “On April 4 at around 3PM, the complainant was sent by her mother to give her father food while he was doing his chores. “The complainant’s father was working with the accused. After eating, the complainant’s father went in search of goats while the complainant went to a room where her father usually charges his phone,” he said. “The accused then followed the complainant to the room. He removed her clothes and inserted his fingers in the complainant’s privates, before raping her.” Mr Ndlovu said the man let go of the girl after she screamed.—@NyarieBakie
