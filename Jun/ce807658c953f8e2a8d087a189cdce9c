Sam Dzvimbu Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter SPORTS and Recreation Commission (SRC) Bulawayo provincial coordinator Sam Dzvimbu has called on sports coaches to register for a sports medicine course set for this weekend in the city. United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) Richard Morris Nurses Home will host the two-day workshop that begins on Saturday and the course is aimed at equipping sports practitioners with the latest trends in sports injury prevention, care and management. The workshop will cover topics such as how to detect and assess injuries, prevention and referral system. “We expect to have a huge turnout this weekend. The response has been good, as we had a lot of people enquiring about the course, so we expect a full house,” said Dzvimbu. “As you know, sport is now highly scientific and we have noted that there is need to move with the latest trends in sports medicine and our hope is that this will help our coaches to assist athletes to prevent potential injuries and in the event that they occur, they know how to care for them. It is also our conviction that if we are to maximise on the potential of athletes, we need to infuse science into training and competition. In modern day sport, this programme is a key component of our sport programmes,” he said. This course is part of the educational drive the SRC has embarked on in implementing its 2018 action plan. Some of the courses it will be offering during the year include sports administration, event management and community sport leader course. Registration fee for the course is $60 and it closes tomorrow.
