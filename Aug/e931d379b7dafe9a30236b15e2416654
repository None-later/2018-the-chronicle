 Andile Tshuma, Business Reporter THE National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) says it has recorded significant growth in its passenger train service following the introduction of new coaches recently. NRZ public relations manager Mr Nyasha Maravanyika said the railway company got a boost from the leased passenger coaches, which are now plying the Victoria Falls-Bulawayo route. Mr Maravanyika said for each trip, there was an average increase of passengers by about 150. “Before we procured the new coaches, we used to ferry about 200 passengers on our Victoria Falls-Bulawayo route on each trip. However, right now, we ferry an average of 350 commuters per trip. This is a significant number, which shows growth,” he said. “The public is excited and has shown great enthusiasm. We are happy to provide a reliable and safe mode of transport.” Mr Maravanyika said the NRZ passenger service was on a positive trajectory since the introduction of new coaches. He said rural communities in particular rely on trains for transport as it was the most affordable. “In some remote rural communities, there is no other mode of transport, save for the train and we are glad to be providing a crucial service to communities,” he said. NRZ acquired new rail equipment to boost its operational efficiency under an interim solution agreement within the $400 million recapitalisation framework with the Diaspora Infrastructure Development Group (DIDG)/Transnet Consortium. The railway company sourced 34 passenger coaches under the deal and seven have since been commissioned. Other equipment comprises 10 brand new main line locomotives, 200 wagons and shunting equipment. NRZ has a fleet of 168 locomotives, 60 of which are in service and more than 7 000 wagons of which 3 512 are in use.
