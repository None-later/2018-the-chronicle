Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter ZANU-PF Youth League will this Saturday launch a membership mobilisation campaign code named #EDhasmyvote to drum up support for President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the revolutionary party ahead of the upcoming harmonised elections. President Mnangagwa has said elections will be held in the next five months. The youth League in Matabeleland North province has postponed indefinitely an inter-district meeting which was scheduled for this Saturday to attend the national launch of #EDhasmyvote on the same day in Harare. Matabeleland North Youth League provincial chairman Cde Tamuka Nyoni said yesterday that the Youth League national office had invited youths from the province to the launch. “After the national political commissar Lieutenant-General Engelbert Rugeje visited the province a fortnight ago, we were supposed to have an inter-district meeting this weekend and Secretary for Youth Affairs Cde Pupurai Togarepi was scheduled to address the meeting. “The meeting has been postponed because we have to go to Harare on Saturday for the launch of the youth mobilisation campaign towards the upcoming elections. The campaign has been called #EDhasmyvote,” said Cde Nyoni. @ncubeleon
