Raj Modi Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE inaugural edition of the Raj Modi Sports Gala will be held this weekend at Sizinda Grounds with over 400 participants expected to take part. The two-day event will be held under the theme “Supporting youth sport is our passion”, with the aim of uplifting young people in Bulawayo South constituency. Modi, who is an aspiring MP for that constituency said: “I have been supporting sport for a long time and I will tell you that sport is my passion.” I’m very excited to be part of this event that uplifts young people in the community. The event is going to be an annual event and I’m certain it will be an even bigger event next year.” 12 netball and 15 football teams are set to feature in the tournament. Modi is bankrolling to the tune of $15 000. A team made up of Bulawayo football legends is set to kick-start the tournament against a liberation war veterans’ side from the constituency. The likes of Madinda Ndlovu, Ronald “Gidiza” Sibanda, Agent Sawu, Siza Khoza and Johannes Ngodzo are set to feature for Bulawayo legends. Sports and Recreation Commission Bulawayo provincial coordinator Sam Dzvimbu said they were bracing for an exciting community sporting event. “This being the first edition of the gala, we will not have too many sport codes. The gala this year will be centered around netball and football, with the hope of introducing more sport codes next year.” The event will also be an opportunity for provincial coaches to select players for the upcoming youth games. We have said for this tournament we want players that are under the age of 23 so that we develop young talent,” said Dzvimbu.
