Arsene Wenger ARSENAL lost 2-1 at Brighton and Hove Albion yesterday, a fourth successive defeat in all competitions for the London club which intensified the pressure on manager Arsene Wenger. After a bright start from the visitors, Lewis Dunk volleyed in to give the home side the lead — ensuring Arsenal’s run without a Premier League clean sheet stretched to 11 games — their longest since February 2002. Glenn Murray’s fifth goal in as many league games made it 2-0 after 26 minutes, before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang pulled a goal back for Arsenal two minutes before halftime. Arsenal improved in the second half, but Brighton held on to secure a third Premier League home victory in a row to go 10th in the table. Arsenal’s eighth defeat in all competitions in 2018 leaves them six, trailing north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in fourth by 13 points.
