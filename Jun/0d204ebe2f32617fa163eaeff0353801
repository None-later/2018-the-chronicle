 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) will hold a children’s athletics workshop at White City Stadium, Bulawayo this weekend as part of its efforts to improve the country’s athletics standards. The course will start on Saturday and end on Sunday, and participants are required to pay a registration fee of $50. Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) chairperson Manuel Mpofu said the course is targeted at teachers because they are on the ground and have daily interaction with the children. “The course will target mainly school teachers, as they are the ones that work with these young athletes on a regular basis. We want those that will attend to work with the youth, clubs and schools. We want them to establish vibrant clubs that will produce quality athletes. “We expect them to impart the correct skills to those they will go back to teach,” said Mpofu. “We want to do away with this mindset that athletics as a one term event in schools. Athletics should be throughout the year if we are to improve the sport in this country. The kids’ athletics event will play a pivotal role in ensuring the development and nurturing of talent at a tender age,” he said. Zimbabwe won nine medals, which including three gold, at the African Junior Championships in Algeria and one athlete reached the 800m finals at the World Youth Championships in Kenya. The next World Junior Championships will be held in Finland later this year and Zimbabwe will be hoping that more athletes perform better on the world stage. — @innocentskizoe
