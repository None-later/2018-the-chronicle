Charles Manyuchi Tadious Manyepo, Harare Bureau AFTER a seven-year flirtation with boxing, where the company has poured in excess of $300 000 into the sport, Mr T35 have terminated their marriage with boxing. This comes as a huge blow particularly to the former world silver welterweight champion, Charles Manyuchi, who was the main benefactor in the company’s deal. During their seven-year stint with the sport, the company made it a point to donate a brand new vehicle on top of other financial rewards to Manyuchi who enjoyed success in the ring for the better part of that period. The 29-year old pugilist received vehicles and financial rewards from the company. In 2016, after knocking out Colombia’s Jose Agustin Feria in a non-title fight at the Harare International Conference Centre in a contest which had been put in place by the company together with Manyuchi’s Zambian promoters Oriental Quarries, the Chivhu-based fighter told our sister paper, The Herald, he would not have made it without Mr T35’s support. “I owe most of my professional success to Mr T35. This company has been there for me and I would not have been where I am if they were not there for me,” he said then. But, the company yesterday announced they were now terminating the relationship, citing financial challenges. “Mr T35 company would like to notify the Zimbabwe Boxing Board that the company has resolved to quit from boxing sponsorship. “We would like to thank the boxing fans for the seven years of support we shared together. We feel we have tried our best to uplift boxing considering all the achievements that we have celebrated and tabled together. “We really appreciate the opportunity afforded to us to showcase our passion in sports,” said Martin Beula, the Mr T35 general manager, in a statement.
