 Veronica Gwaze in LUSAKA, Zambia ZIMBABWE’S Gems are on cloud nine after boosting their qualifying chances for the 2019 World Cup finals in Liverpool by handing rivals Zambia a 64-41 defeat at the African Championships here yesterday. In an intense battle that started off with the hosts leading 4-0, Zimbabwe were quick to up their game and turn it around. The Gems led 33-25 at the break. But they dominated the last quarter and were full value for their victory. “The first quarter was a tough one,’’ coach Lloyd Makunde said. ‘’I talked to the girls and asked them why they were adapting to the Zambian game, which is definitely not what we have been doing in terms of our training. “I reminded them of the Championship and the World Cup and I am glad they played according to instruction when they came back.’’ Makunde is confident of victory when they face Namibia. Zambian Charles Zulu said while the loss was a setback, they remained optimistic they will make it to the World Cup. ‘’Yes, we have lost to Zimbabwe but I am hopeful of qualification for the World Cup.’’ This is the fourth time, in a row, that the Zimbabwe Gems have beaten their Zambia counterparts.
