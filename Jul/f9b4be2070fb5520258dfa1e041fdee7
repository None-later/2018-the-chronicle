Junior Sables team Mehluli Sibanda in Paarl, South Africa AFTER a hard-fought win over South African Learners with Special Education Needs (SA LSEN ) in their opening match at the Under-18 Coca-Cola Academy Week, the Old Mutual Zimbabwe Under-18 face a stiffer task against the Blue Bulls Country Districts at Paarl Boys High School this afternoon. The Junior Sables had a nervy start to this year’s Academy Week, with a 29-27 win over SA LSEN in a match they should have won by a wider margin. Blue Bulls Country Districts also won their first match of the Academy Week 27-22 against Sharks. Zimbabwe have to up their game this afternoon, as the Blue Bulls CD are likely to pose a bigger threat. The tournament rules stipulate that every member of the squad must play at least a full match and Zimbabwe have made eight changes to the side that beat SA LSEN. Skipper Matthew Owuru is one of those who have retained their places in the starting 15, while flank David Bore, who was voted man-of-the-match against SA LSEN, drops to the bench.
