Anti-corruption protesters gathered outside the official residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem al-Quds on Friday, as the premier was set to be interrogated by police over allegations of bribery in the Bezeq probe. Demonstrators held a large banner with Netanyahu’s portrait and a sign reading, “Crime Minister.” They welcomed investigators who were arriving to the residence to question Netanyahu and chanted slogans such as “People demand justice” in front of the vehicles. The final decision on whether the prime minister will face charges will be made by the attorney general’s office. — PressTV.
