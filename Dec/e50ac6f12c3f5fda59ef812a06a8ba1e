A 46-YEAR-OLD woman is demanding more than $1 300 maintenance a month from her husband of over 16 years. Mrs Faith Sundirayi Mtisi of Bulawayo’s Montrose suburb dragged her husband, Mr Samson Mtisi, to the Maintenance Court accusing him of failing to take care of her and their three children. Mtisi, a National University of Science and Technology (Nust) lecturer, appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Ulukile Muleya but the matter did not proceed as he said he wanted to seek legal representation. The couple’s children are aged 16, 11 and four. Mrs Mtisi filed for $1 304 maintenance and said $570 is spousal maintenance while the remainder is for the children’s upkeep. She was being represented by Mr James Dhliwayo of Dhliwayo and Partners. “The respondent is a lecturer at Nust who apart from his salary is entitled to allowances. The respondent is well able to contribute the sum of money being claimed,” said Mr Dhliwayo on behalf of his client. Mr Mtisi asked the court to postpone the matter so he could engage a lawyer since his wife is represented. Ms Muleya remanded the case to December 5. — @andile_tshuma
