 Michelle Gwizi, Court Reporter A MAN from Mzilikazi in Bulawayo allegedly burnt property worth $130 at his friend’s home in a fit of rage after knocking on the door and getting no response. Mfanelo Mpofu (38) allegedly set Ms Betty Nguwo (63)’s house alight on Tuesday and burnt her blankets, curtains and a mattress. He was allegedly furious after Ms Nguwo’s son Mr Blessing Siwela ignored his   knock. Mpofu pleaded guilty to the damage of property before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Adelaide Mbeure yesterday. Ms Mbeure remanded him in custody to today for a trial date. Mr Siwela told the court Mpofu started a number of fires in the house. “I recall on July 31 Mpofu knocked at the front door. I was responding to the knock when he lit matches and burnt the curtains. He proceeded to my room and lit some more matches, setting my blankets and mattress on fire,” said Mr Siwela. “I poured water on the burning curtain and mattress. Kelvin Moyo and Tafadzwa Dzingai assisted me to stop the fire and prevent further damage,” he added. Prosecuting, Mr Charles Danda alleged the fire brigade was called to contain the fire. The court heard that the property lost is worth $130. — @gwizi_n
