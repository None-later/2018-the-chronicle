However, she has been off television screens for a while as she has been focusing on new ventures to expand her brand. Chronicle Showbiz caught up with Hlabangana and she told us what she has been up to. “I’ve been hustling, running errands, networking, freelancing and building my brand. I’m in a space where I live, breathe and think content creation and finding unique ways of executing it. “I can’t wait to launch one of my biggest creations,” said Hlabangana. She said working with some of Zimbabwe’s leading media houses as a presenter, producer, content creator, innovator and digital and social media coordinator had helped a lot. “I’ve accumulated great lessons in a space of roughly seven years with five companies. “During my free time, I blog about my personal inspirational content, record my podcast sessions and have recently started a YouTube channel that is surprisingly doing well.”
