Russell Mhiribidi Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter A SPORTS development organisation from Finland, Liike, in partnership with the Sports Leaders Institute of Zimbabwe (Sliz), will next month hold an international sports management course in Harare. The programme is targeting sports clubs executives, sports industry administrators, physical education and sport teachers, lecturers, sports directors, Nash and Naph members and will run from May 14-15 at Msasa’s MTB. Russell Mhiribidi, the Sliz director, said the seminar’s topic is “Global trends in sport management and resource mobilisation”. “It is our hope that the participants will immensely benefit from the programme as we strive towards having a vibrant sports industry. “Participants will be taught on strategic management of sports organisations, which is commercialising sport. “We’ll also cover financial management and resource mobilisation, media and sport development, running sport/physical education department and sports ethics and ethical decision making process,” said Mhiribidi. The course facilitator will be Ari Johannes Kouvi, the Liike executive director. Mhiribidi said registration for the programme has opened and the course fee is $100. Sliz has been holding sports management camps since 2014. The camps have been used as platforms for administrators to brainstorm and come up with solutions to challenges that face the development of athletes. They have also been using the camps to preach the gospel of good governance in sport, with the view of helping administrators unlock potential partnerships with the corporate world. Last year Sliz held a similar course in partnership with West Virginia University. @ZililoR
