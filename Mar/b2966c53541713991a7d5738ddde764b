Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Acting Sports Editor LUVEVE Stadium will today play host to 16 Bulawayo National Association of Secondary Schools (Nash)  provincial drum majorettes competition meant to choose the city’s representatives at the national finals that will be held during the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair next month. Amhlophe High School headmistress, Thokozile Tshabalala, who is the Bulawayo Nash head in charge of drum majorettes said all was in place for today’s provincial finals. “We are preparing for our Nash national competitions which will be held at the ZITF next month,” she said. Today’s event will be graced by Eunice Dlamini of M & M Joyous Events who will be the guest of honour while an invite was also extended to the Minister of Primary and Secondary Education Paul Mavima who promised to find time and also grace the competition. Dlamini was voted the Megafest Northen Region Businesswoman of the Year in 2014 for successfully running her business concern, M & M Joyous Events, which specialises in events management. She was also voted the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce Matabeleland Businesswoman of the Year 2014 and also received an award of excellence in business in 2012. In 2012, she was voted the Entrepreneur of the Year for the Southern Region. The provincial teams will be under the coordination of Phillis Mapingire and Shamiso Gwinji of Amhlophe High School. In today’s competition, the participants will be judged in four categories, uniform, leader, sub leader and squad. Last year’s provincial winners were Msiteli High School and they will obviously be the school to beat this time around although they will face stiff competition from Amhlophe, Pumula, Magwegwe and Founders High Schools. As part of the adjudication process, the girls will be given a minimum of seven and a maximum of 10 minutes each during the adjudication process where the judges will be looking at a number of things. — @skhumoyo2000.
