 Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu,  Gwanda Correspondent FOUR people have died in two separate accidents which occurred in Nkankezi and just outside Gwanda in Matabeleland South Province. Matabeleland South acting provincial police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Loveness Mangena said three people died on Sunday at around 7PM in Nkankezi at the 192 kilometre peg along the Masvingo- Mbalabala Road while one person died on the same day at around 9PM in Maphane just outside Gwanda at the 130 kilometre peg along Bulawayo- Beitbridge Road. “I can confirm that there are two accidents which occurred where four people died on the spot. An unregistered Toyota Wish vehicle was travelling along Masvingo- Mbalabala Road heading towards Mbalabala with nine passengers on board. “At the 192 kilometre peg the driver lost control of the vehicle and it veered off the road to the left. It overturned once and landed on its wheels. Three adults Khuthawanga Saini, Wadzanayi Chikore and Mkhululi Nyoni died on the spot while six other people were injured and taken to Filabusi Hospital,” she said. Ass Insp Mangena added: “In the second incident, a South African registered Toyota double cab was travelling along the Bulawayo- Beitbridge Road with four passengers on board headed for Beitbridge. When the driver reached the 130 kilometre peg near Maphane Business Centre, he lost control of the vehicle and it veered off the road, overturned once and landed on its roof.” Ass Insp Mangena said the driver Mehluli Sibanda died on the spot while all four passengers escaped unharmed. She appealed to motorists to exercise extreme caution and to adhere to road regulations when driving. “Motorists have to realise that they have a responsibility for the safety of their passengers and as such they should exercise extreme caution and adhere to road regulations. A number of lives are lost in road accidents just because of negligence by some motorists,” she said.—@DubeMatutu
