Thandiwe Katinhimure, Business Reporter THE Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC) has partnered with an international organisation, WEConnect to facilitate growth and development of women businesses in the country across the value chains. WEConnect is an international organisation which seeks to help women-owned businesses succeed by educating, registering and certifying their business enterprises in and outside the United States. Businesses that are supported by WEConnect should be at least 51 percent owned by women, managed and controlled by one or more women. Upon meeting the above conditions, WEConnet links qualifying businesses with multinational corporate buyers. “The ZNCC Women’s Desk has partnered with WEConnect as it already has the best practice in such a programme. “The partnership will avail opportunities for women in Zimbabwe in the global value chain. “Women business owners are optimistic about the future and almost all businesswomen in Zimbabwe plan to grow their businesses over the next three to five years,” said ZNCC. It quoted WEConnect saying women-owned businesses have been growing at twice the rate of all business for nearly two decades. Against this background, the international organisation said it was paramount for the communities to support women-owned enterprises by providing sustainable markets for their products. ZNCC said their partnership augurs well with WEConnect as it has also embarked on women empowerment programmes encouraging women to start, own and run businesses. As part of their efforts to encourage women to start, own and run businesses, ZNCC in 2016 introduced the Woman-Owned Campaign. The campaign is an initiative to enable consumers to identify products and services supplied by women owned businesses during their shopping experience.
