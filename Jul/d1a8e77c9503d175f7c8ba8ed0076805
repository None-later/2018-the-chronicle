 Walter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent ZANU-PF is poised for another clean sweep of National Assembly seats in Masvingo in the forthcoming harmonised elections slated for July 30, a senior party official has said. Chief Whip Cde Lovemore Matuke said candidates were not leaving any stone unturned campaigning for President Mnangagwa, National Assembly and council seats.  Zanu PF won all 26 seats contested in the 2013 harmonised elections in Masvingo. Cde Matuke said from the assessment he had made the party had an upper hand on opposition candidates in all constituencies and nothing would stop the ruling party from maintaining its dominance. “We had a meeting with all aspiring MPs from which we got feedback on the progress since we are campaigning. I am convinced that the party has high chances of winning all 26 National Assembly seats in Masvingo province,” said Cde Matuke. The Zanu-PF National Secretary for Security said he was satisfied with the way the campaigns were moving and all the candidates had enough resources to reach out to their supporters. “The party has provided all districts with vehicles and enough fuel for its activities. Candidates have also received vehicles. “This will ensure they reach out to the supporters. From the information we have gathered as senior members, nothing can stop us from maintaining our dominance in the province,” he said. @walterbmswazie2
