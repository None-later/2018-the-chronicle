Joice Mujuru Oliver Kazunga, Senior Reporter National reconciliation and healing will never be achieved in Zimbabwe as long as the issue on the 1980s disturbances in Matabeleland and Midlands provinces is swept under the carpet. People’s Rainbow Coalition (PRC) president Dr Joice Mujuru said this while addressing her party’s supporters at Tshabalala Hall in Bulawayo Sunday. She said whatever evil deeds committed in the past, the PRC was there to promote “total” reconciliation and national healing so that the nation is left in unity and peace when political elders depart. She said “total” reconciliation and national healing required collective effort from across the political divide to address the indelible wounds that were left as a result of the 1980s atrocities. “Today’s meeting was just an eye-opener, as PRC we will come on another day for a similar meeting to say out more. The rallies aren’t our campaign approach but it is through such meetings as today’s that help us to share with you the heart rending matters,” she said. President Mnangagwa signed the National Peace and Reconciliation Bill into law a few months ago to, among other issues, tackle the emotive issue. @okazunga
