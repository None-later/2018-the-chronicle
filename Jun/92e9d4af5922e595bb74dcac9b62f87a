 Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter FIVE masked men allegedly brutally killed a 64-year-old man with axes and machetes in Inyathi. Police yesterday said the cold blooded murder happened at around 1AM on Monday at the victim’s homestead and the killers are still at large. They are yet to establish a motive for the attack. Mika Mpala of 1C, Mucklenuck area, under Chief Mtshana, died on the spot from multiple injuries all over the body and head. His attackers ruthlessly slashed him with machetes and ferociously axed him multiple times. National police spokesperson Chief Superintendent Paul Nyathi said a manhunt had been launched for the suspects. “Police are conducting investigations into a suspected murder case which occurred at a village in Inyathi where a 64-year-old man was attacked by five unknown men. They confronted him while he slept in his bedroom at his home and attacked him with varying weapons leaving him for dead. “We are appealing to members of the public who may have information that may lead to the arrest of suspects, who are still at large, to contact their nearest police stations,” he said. A villager that preferred anonymity said the suspects, who all wore balaclavas, savagely killed the old man for unknown reasons. “They opened Mpala’s bedroom door that wasn’t locked and one of them lit a torch and ordered his wife, Petty Luphahla (50), to go outside. One suspect  force marched her outside, a few metres away from the bedroom, while the other four remained inside. Two of them carried machetes while the other two carried axes. “They attacked him and he screamed. His wife helplessly cried outside. They dashed from the blood drenched room and disappeared into the darkness. “Luphahla later called for help and neighbours who rushed to the scene discovered the old man’s body,” said the source. The matter was reported to the police who attended to the scene and the body was taken to Inyathi District Hospital. @winnie_masara
