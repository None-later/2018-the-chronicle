 Nothabo Nyathi, Chronicle Reporter TWO elderly villagers from Lupinyu just outside Victoria Falls have been arrested for killing a kudu worth $2 000. Mike Mathe (60) and Chanda Ncube (58) who reside at separate homesteads in BH 118 Lupinyu killed a kudu after they set twenty snares in Matetsi. The accused persons pleaded guilty to poaching when they appeared before Victoria Falls magistrate Ms Rangarirai Gakanje. Mathe who was convicted for the same crime in 2014 was sentenced to eight months in jail while Ncube was sentenced to six months. However, the two will not taste jail as the magistrate suspended two months from each of their sentences on condition that they do not commit a similar crime within the next five years. The remaining months were suspended on condition that the duo performs community service at Jabula Primary School in Lusulu. Mathe will perform 210 hours for six weeks while Ncube will perform 140 hours for four weeks. Mathe told the court that he wanted to provide food for his five children since he is unemployed and has no source of income. Ncube said poverty forced him to commit the offence. @nyathi_nothabo
