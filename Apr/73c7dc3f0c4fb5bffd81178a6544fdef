Bulawayo Chiefs midfielder Gracious Muleya’s (out of picture) header beats Chapungu goalkeeper Talbert Shumba in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match played at Luveve Stadium yesterday — Picture Obey Sibanda Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter Bulawayo Chiefs 1-0 Chapungu BULAWAYO Chiefs registered their first Castle Lager Premier Soccer League victory of the season as they took their unbeaten run to four games courtesy of a last-gasp goal by midfielder, Gracious Muleya. Going into yesterday’s game, the Premiership newboys had three points from three games. Muleya’s headed goal sent a sizeable number of Chiefs supporters into a frenzy while breaking the hearts of a handful Chapungu supporters whose team played better than the hosts at Luveve Stadium. With the game yesterday seemingly headed for a draw, defensive midfielder Muleya rose high above the rest to head home the winner in the 90th minute, connecting with a well taken Moses Majika corner-kick. Bulawayo Chiefs’ fitness trainer Thulani Sibanda was elated with the victory. “I think it was a balanced game, we are happy to have scored that goal in the last minute. I think we are improving. The victory certainly is a confidence booster. We have been playing very well in the last games though we failed to get maximum points.  Today we did not play really well but we are happy to collect maximum points,” said Sibanda. Chapungu head coach, Tendai Chikuni, rued missed chances for his sides lost. “Well it was a game of two halves, they controlled the first half and we came out strong in the second half, but at this level of competition when you waste your chances you are punished, that is what happened to us today. As a coach you want to win every game, when that does not happen you obviously get worried,” said Chikuni. The first half was a subdued affair with little goal-mouth action. The visitors were first to threaten five minutes into the game with Edmore Muzanenhamo’s glancing header going inches over the cross-bar. A minute later Blessing Sahondo’s effort from inside the box hit the cross bar after he was set up by Ian Nyoni, following an impressive run on the right. The hosts first clear cut chance came in the 29th minute when Moses Majika roasted his marker on the right to set up exciting midfielder Perfect Chikwende whose weak effort from inside the box was easily saved by Talbert Shumba in goal for Chapungu. Five minutes after the break Chiefs midfielder Arthur Musiyiwa broke on the left to set up unmarked Majika in the box, but the latter took too long to shoot allowing Chapungu to clear their lines. A minute later Majika was back to trouble the Chapungu defence, this time his left footed effort from the edge of the box was tipped over the cross-bar by Shumba. Chapungu had the lion’s share of possession in the second stanza with Allan Tavarwisa giving the Chiefs defence anxious moments with his pace and power. Blessing Sahondo wasted the visitors’ best scoring opportunity after failing to tap in a Tavarwisa cross in the late stages of the game with Chiefs’ keeper Kelvin Nyoni nowhere in sight.
