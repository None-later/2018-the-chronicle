JAZZ, Afro Soul and Deejaying will be fused together as a way to express the varying talents of Bulawayo’s female artistes during the inaugural Shikisha Nite Fest being held at the New Alabama on Unity Day (December 22). The event, a brainchild of Nkwali, will see her performing alongside Qeqeshiwe Mntambo, Thandi Dlana, Mimi, DJ Noma that Girl and Gugu. Nkwali whose Rafiki house track is doing rounds said she had organised the event in an effort to bring together the best female acts in Bulawayo for one night of great music. She said there were not many shows in the city that catered for female musicians hence why she came up with this concept. “We want to uplift each other as female musicians. This is also an opportunity for us to share notes to strengthen each other. It’ll be a rare event as we’ll have the very best female artistes under one roof and hopefully people will enjoy,” said Nkwali. Qeqe, who is remembered for her track Kumnyama, marked her return this year after featuring on DJ MduSevan’s Uyangithanda Na. Thandi Dlana also seems to be making a comeback into the industry. It has been a good year for up-and-coming songbird Mimi as she released a track called Khetha that has been getting heavy rotation on local radio stations. This has landed her two nominations at the Skyz Metro FM Music awards. The Shikisha Fest will be an opportunity for Gugu, who has shared the stage with Ammara Brown, to impress again. With DJ Noma that Girl who is one of the top rated female wheelspinners in Bulawayo on board, it will be interesting to see how these varying acts will be fused together during the Shikisha Fest on Saturday.
