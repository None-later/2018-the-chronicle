 Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter BULAWAYO province will play host to the 2018 edition of the National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) track and field athletics tournament that has tentatively been set for March. According to a calendar of events released by the Nash national head-in-charge of athletics Phillip Chikomwe, the meet will be held at White City Stadium from March 22-23 and the championship will see the 4X400m mixed relay in all age groups debuting. “The new mixed relay will have two boys and two girls in all age groups,” said Chikomwe. He said provincials have been set for March 8-9 while district finals should be held from February 22-23. “Zonal competitions should be through by February 9,” he said. Chikomwe said the three age groups will be composed of the 15 years and under, 17 years and under as well as the 20 years and under athletes.
