 Nyaradzo Bakari, Chronicle Reporter A Bulawayo man arrested for allegedly assaulting a thief he caught stealing from his garden, is now facing murder charges after the victim died as a result of injuries sustained following the assault. Lovemore Mugunda (41) from Cowdray Park suburb allegedly struck Coleman Sibanda (24) from Emganwini suburb once on the head and on the arm with a hoe after he caught him red-handed stealing sugarcane from his garden last week. Sibanda was rushed to Mpilo Central Hospital where he later died. The court heard that the deceased sustained severe head injuries following the assault. Mugunda was last Thursday not asked to plead to murder when he appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Stephen Ndhlovu. He was remanded out of custody on $100 bail. Mugunda is represented by Mr Bob Siansole of Tanaka Law Chambers. Prosecuting, Mrs Memory Ndlovu said Mugunda assaulted Sibanda on Sunday morning last week when he caught him stealing from his garden. @NyarieBakie
