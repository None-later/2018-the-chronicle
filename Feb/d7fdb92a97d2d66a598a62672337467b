 Lovemore Zigara in Gweru RENOVATIONS have started at Maglas Stadium ahead of the 2018 Castle Lager Premiership season expected to kick-off on March 10. Maglas was condemned by the Zifa First Instance Board (FIB), which recently went on a countrywide tour examining the clubs’ adherence to the Fifa Club Licensing system. The FIB recommended that Maglas needs touch-ups on its turf, the dressing rooms and doping area, among other areas. Shabanie Mine secretary Munyaradzi Nyashanu said work is already underway and expressed confidence that it will be completed by the time the season kicks off. “We approached the owners of the stadium —Shabanie Mashava Mines, who have already started work on the stadium. Actually work on Maglas started last week, starting with the turf, while some work started today (yesterday) on the dressing rooms and doping areas,” said Nyashanu. “Other areas which will also be refurbished include the media area as well as the VVIP enclosure and as a club we are happy that we have been assured that work will be completed before the season kicks off.” Maglas is one of the stadiums that was condemned when the FIB carried out inspections earlier this month. Should the facility not be up to standard by the time the season kicks off, the Chinda Boys might be forced to play their home matches at Mandava Stadium, home to their neighbours and bitter rivals FC Platinum. In Gweru, work is also underway at Ascot Stadium, with engineers on the ground to ensure that the facility meets the minimum standards ahead of the season. Ascot will be home to Air Force of Zimbabwe side Chapungu and Premiership newcomers Nichrut this season. @lavuzigara1
