 Showbiz Reporter THOUSANDS of music fans and tourists from across the region converged on Livingstone on Friday for the Mosi Day of Thunder music festival – an event similar to the Victoria Falls Carnival. The line-up of artists included well-established Zambian names such as Wezi, Bobby East, T-Sean, Ma Africa, Afunika, King Illest, DJ Sebastien Dutch, DJ Nano and Vjeezy as well as surprise appearances by Slap Dee and Roberto, who joined Nigerian rap supremo Patoranking. An estimated 10 000 revellers turned up for the Zambian Breweries-sponsored event which, now in its third year, has become a highlight of the Zambian entertainment and social calendar. Festival-goers also gained free entry to the Mosi-Oa-Tunya (Victoria) Falls as part of the company’s ongoing partnership with the Zambia Ministry of Tourism and Arts and the National Conservation Commission to promote that country’s tourism, arts and culture. The Mosi Day of Thunder, which took place on Africa Freedom Day, also coincided with the Zambia Tourism Agency’s annual cultural tourism festival, the Livingstone International Cultural and Arts Festival (LICAF) where Bulawayo dance groups Thandanani Women’s Ensemble and Iluba Lemvelo performed. The Zimbabwe Tourism Authority was also in attendance. Speaking during the event, Zambian Breweries Head of Marketing Sibajene Munkombwe said: “We’re happy to be associated with promoting the music industry in Zambia and also partnering with international acts to give people an exciting time.” In addition to promoting Livingstone as a destination for domestic, regional and international tourists, the Mosi Day of Thunder created additional employment for Livingstone people who provided security, catering and support services.
