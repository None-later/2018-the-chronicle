Richard Muponde, Plumtree Correspondent ZANU-PF is confident of winning all the 13 parliamentary seats in Matabeleland South given its sound economic policies and the ongoing fight against corruption, a senior party member has said. The party won resoundingly in 2013 harmonised elections, bagging all the seats from the opposition which had held fort since 2000. Addressing an inter-district meeting for Bulilima District on Wednesday, Central Committee member, Cde Richard Maduke Ndlovu said party cadres should rally behind the cause of the party and put differences aside. ‘I’m inspired by a man who was in the papers who saved his wife from the jaws of a crocodile when she was attacked while in Victoria Falls and went on to wed after the incident, that’s being a family. As party members we should work together no matter what has happened,” said Cde Ndlovu. The former legislator for Bulilima-Mangwe  north said the province was going to retain all the 13 seats. “Let’s vote for Zanu PF. From 2000 up to 2013 we had exactly 13 years of trouble because these seats belonged to the opposition which was not in Government. Programmes only move when your representative is in the ruling party. Let’s fight for one cause and be united. I’m the most senior person here; let’s be united. I’m 100 percent behind those elected although I didn’t manage to clinch the senatorial seat (won by Ambassador Simon Khaya Moyo),” he said. Cde Ndlovu was MP for the ruling party in his rural home from 1988 to 2000 when MDC won. President Emmerson Mnangagwa launched the Zanu-PF election campaign and manifesto in Harare last week.  He expressed confidence that the party will resoundingly win the elections scheduled for July, riding on its sound economic policies and the zeal to root out corruption.—@richardmuponde.
