The Chronicle Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief
CHIEF Shumba of the ED Pfee hit track is back with a bang with a new song titled Mushana paJecha. Born Admire Sibanda, Chief Shumba co-wrote Mushana paJecha with prominent young farmer Cde John Muchenje from the Midlands province. He said the song that was released at President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s Thank You rally held in Mashonaland West two weeks ago, was aimed at those who are bent on causing mayhem and disorder in the country. “Through this song, we want to raise awareness to the youths and those bent on causing mayhem in the country that each and every Zimbabwean has a role to play in socio-economic emancipation of the country. We need to work together and not throw spanners in the works,” Chief Shumba said. He said he was saddened two weeks ago when Winky D dropped the track Kasong Kejecha in which he is trying to mobilise people to disrupt Government programmes. Due to its political undertones, the song was embraced by those inclined to opposition politics, who like Winky D, are seeking relevance through nauseating attention-seeking gimmicks. “It’s sad we have the opposition and artistes like Winky D saying they will pour jecha (sand) on national programmes spearheaded by the new dispensation. When the Zanu-PF Government embarks on programmes, they don’t only benefit Zanu-PF party supporters but every Zimbabwean. “There’s therefore need for all Zimbabweans to work together as one instead of thinking of pouring sand on others,” said Chief Shumba. Cde Muchenje said they composed the song to correct the mindset of the youths so that they are not swayed by the destructive individuals in thinking that kudira jecha is the way to solve problems. “With this song, we wanted to counter Winky D and the elements among him who are anti-progress. As youths, we’re the future leaders of this country so I wanted to educate the youth not to be used by people who are against development.
