 Thandiwe Katinhimure, Business Reporter THE Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) Company is seeking the services of a financial and transaction advisor as it gears for the construction of its 300-bed hotel and 800-seater convention centre. Management is on record pledging to ensure a bankable proposal was put in place by the first quarter of this year to raise capital for implementing the project. The ZITF Company said it has decided to carry out the process for selection of a financial consultant and transaction advisor. “ZITF Company hereby invites proposals from interested firms for selection of a financial advisor and transaction advisor who shall develop a revenue model and appropriate structure for the project, prepare bid documents for selection of the investor and assist ZITF Company in the selection process,” it said in a statement. The company said previous feasibility studies to determine the technical feasibility and financial viability for the convention centre have been conducted. “The drive is to modernise and enhance the capacity utilisation of the exhibition centre, position the city of Bulawayo as a meetings destination and also complement the existing tourism infrastructure in the country,” the ZITF company said. It advised interested bidders that the request for proposal document can be obtained up to March 14 upon presenting proof of payment of a non-refundable fee of $100. Over the years, the ZITF Company has been partnering with Ecological Safaris as part of efforts to ease accommodation challenges in Bulawayo during the trade fair. It is hoped that the proposed 300-bed hotel will reduce accommodation challenges in Bulawayo especially during the annual trade showcase. — @thandyfeminine
