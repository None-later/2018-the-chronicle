Aaron Jani Petros Kausiyo, Harare Bureau ZIMBABWE Rugby Union president Aaron Jani was a relieved man after the Sables finally found a way to win with a deserved 38-18 victory over Uganda in Kampala on Saturday. The victory ensured they avoided relegation and retained their place in the Rugby Africa Gold Cup. The Sables’ poor campaign had not only ended their hopes for a place at next year’s World Cup in Japan but had also heaped pressure on coach Peter De Villiers, the players and Jani’s leadership. Jani, in rallying the Sables ahead of their clash against Uganda, challenged them to fight for their reputations and the reputation of the country. The ZRU boss praised his players’ work ethic and “never say die spirit.’’
