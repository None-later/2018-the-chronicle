TWO of Tsholotsho’s finest football exports Joel Luphahla and Lizwe Sweswe are expected to grace this year’s edition of the Madlangombe football tournament which is bankrolled by the South Africa based duo of Mthabisi Mlingo and Mthoniselwa Dumane. The tournament, in its eighth year now, will be held about 35KM from Tsholotsho business centre on December 28 and will feature four teams, two from Bulawayo and the same number from Tsholotsho. According to one of the sponsors, Mlingo, the two teams from Bulawayo will be Bhulubisa who are the cup holders of the tournament and Buffalo Strikers while Godweni and Mukandume are the host teams. “As usual the tournament will start from the semi final stage with Bhulubisa clashing against Mukandume while Buffalo Strikers will lock horns with Godweni with the winners of the semis going through to the finals that will be preceded by the third place play off,” said Mlingo. He encouraged teams to field youngsters who still have an opportunity of being snatched by scouts especially since the tournament will be graced by Luphahla, who led TelOne FC to the Central Region Division One League title and promotion into the Premier Soccer League and Sweswe who is an assistant to the PSL champions FC Platinum coach, Norman Mapeza. “We deliberately scheduled these games at this time of the year because we normally read a lot of negative stories about some of our colleagues based in South Africa and I am saying not everyone is of that mentality. It is infact disheartening to associate us with inhuman activities all the time hence this positive development,” said Mlingo. Tsholotsho Rural District Council chairperson Esau Siwela is also expected to attend the event.
