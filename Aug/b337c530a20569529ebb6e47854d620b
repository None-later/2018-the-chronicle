The late Thokozile Mathuthu Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent ZANU-PF Matabeleland North province has seconded its provincial Women’s League chairperson Cde Medeline Bhebhe to replace late national heroine Cde Thokozile Mathuthu as Senator for the province. Cde Mathuthu succumbed to cancer on Monday last week and was buried on Sunday at the National Heroes’ Acre in Harare. She had been elected as one of the three Zanu-PF senators in the July 30 harmonised elections. In an interview yesterday, Zanu-PF Matabeleland North provincial chairman Cde Richard Moyo confirmed that Cde Bhebhe would be elevated to be Senator. “We are just going to follow the senatorial list that the party had submitted before the elections. Accordingly, Cde Medeline Bhebhe will now become a Senator for Matabeleland North replacing our late heroine Cde Mathuthu,” said Cde Moyo. He said the other two Senators are Politburo member and Home Affairs and Culture Minister Cde Obert Mpofu and Central Committee member, Cde Alice Dube. “We followed the Zebra system in the selection of senators. Meaning we had to pick a woman to replace a woman. “Cde Bhebhe was third in the women’s list so she comes first to replace the departed member,” said Cde Moyo. @nqotshili
