Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter MATABELELAND Amateur Swimming Board (MASB) has welcomed moves by the Bulawayo City Council to refurbish the Luveve and Mpopoma public swimming pools, saying this would help its efforts to rebuild a vibrant swimming league in the city. Council has announced that it is planning to refurbish and commission the two pools this year. MASB press and liaison officer Thomas Werret said they’d been working tirelessly to improve the standard of swimming in Bulawayo and with more pools set to be opened, their efforts can only be boosted. “We are very excited with the prospect of having more functional pools in the city. Firstly that will ensure we have more clubs in the league and more people will take up swimming. The past year was successful for swimming and we look forward to building on the gains,” said Werret. He said more swimmers were sent to South Africa last year compared to previous years and the number of affiliated swimmers had risen. “A number of old records tumbled last year, which is evidence that we are on the right track. Schools have played a pivotal role in the progress we have made. Our hope is to have more schools coming to support the sport. They have shown passion for the sport and encouraged students to take up swimming, which has helped a lot. “We want people from all walks of life to support swimming so that we make it a bigger and better sport.” — @innocentskizoe
