Sithethelelwe Sibanda Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter Namibia 0-2 Zimbabwe THE Mighty Warriors put themselves on course to progress to the next and final round of the Africa Women Cup of Nations qualifiers with an away victory over their first leg opponents Namibia at the Sam Nujoma Stadium in Windhoek last night. Two goals by the experienced duo of Marjory Nyahumwe in the 24th minute and Mavis Chirandu right at the end of the encounter ensured that the girls put one foot into the next round ahead of the second leg set for Rufaro Stadium on Sunday. The winner of the first round encounter will square off against either Tanzania or Zambia in the June final qualifier for the finals which are set for Ghana from November 17 to December 1 this year. It is most likely that Sithethelelwe “Kwinji 15” Sibanda’s  girls will meet their Zambezi rivals, Zambia, in the next round as Shepolopolo managed to hold Tanzania to a 3-3 draw in their first leg on Wednesday. Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, Cameroon and South Africa have been given a bye in the first round to the second round. Nigeria are the defending African champions following their triumph in the 2016 edition held in Cameroon. The eight team continental tournament in Ghana will also serve as a qualification tournament for Women’s World Cup finals to be hosted by France in 2019. Meawhile, Zifa communications manager, Xolisani Gwesela, said the victorious girls return home today and they are not likely to break camp until the Sunday decider.
