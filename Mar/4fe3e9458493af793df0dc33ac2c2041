 Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau Police in Beitbridge have launched a manhunt for three men who allegedly robbed four people of a vehicle, $3 035 and R20 000 early on Thursday morning. The trio is reportedly armed with two pistols. The suspects first pounced on Ishmael Chinyana (43) who was using his black Honda Fit as a pirate taxi, around 2:30 AM. The suspects hired Chinyana from Kalahari Nightclub intending to go to White Lodge along the Bulawayo-Beitbridge Road. Along the way they produced a firearm and abducted him. They drove to a bushy area in Makakavule village, where they tied Chinyana to a tree using their shoe laces. “They drove in Chinyana’s vehicle to Total Service station, where they approached one fuel attended and two illegal money changers,” said a soured close to the case. “They pretended to be potential clients seeking to exchange bond notes for South African rand. Soon after agreeing on an exchange rate the accused persons produced two pistols and demanded cash. “They then took away $3 035 in bond notes and R26 000 from the three men and drove away along the Bulawayo road”. The official said the value of the vehicle, with registration numbers AEO9811 was yet to be ascertained, adding that a manhunt was on for the trio. According to the source, Chinyana later managed to untie himself and went on to report the robbery at Makakavule Police Station. The trio of Edmore Ndou (fuel attended) and Patrick Nyemudzai (39) and Nhamo Charamba (46) both money changers, made a report at the main police station. Matabeleland South acting police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Loveness Mangena said the matter was still under investigation.
