Dr Gerald Gwinji Thandeka Moyo, Health Reporter THE Ministry of Health and Child Care has put measures to contain cholera following an outbreak in Zambia. In an interview yesterday, the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health and Child Care Retired Brigadier General Dr Gerald Gwinji said so far no case of cholera has been detected in the country. “There is a cholera outbreak in Lusaka, Zambia with cases now approaching close to 3 000. We know that we have got a lot of vehicles and people going in and out of Zambia for various reasons therefore we need to be on the alert. “Main ports of entry include Chirundu and Victoria Falls and we have alerted the provincial teams there to take the necessary caution and we have pre-positioned cholera response kits in the two provinces so that should anything happen then they act appropriately,” said Dr Gwinji. He said the national inter agency group which deals with diseases will meet to discuss the issue tomorrow. Zambia is struggling to contain the cholera outbreak that has killed an estimated 65 people across the country since October 2017. Dr Gwinji advised the public to avoid unnecessary travel to the neighbouring country. “We are not saying people should not travel to Zambia but we are encouraging those who do not have pressing issues to postpone and if the journey cannot be avoided, the individuals must practice good hygiene,” said Dr Gwinji. Government has tightened border controls and mobilised resources following heightened fears of a possible cholera outbreak in the country as Zimbabwe shares borders with Zambia. Cholera is infectious and causes severe watery diarrhoea, which can lead to dehydration and even death if untreated.—.@thamamoe.
