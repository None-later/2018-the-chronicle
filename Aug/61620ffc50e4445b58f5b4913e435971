Facebook Response to “ED in Namibia for Sadc talks.” It is business as usual. I am glad nothing is stopping the President to perform his duties, not even Chamisa.  — Sifikile Moyo. SMS/WHATSAPP Indeed our President`s diary goes beyond 2018. His colleagues in Sadc welcomed him as one elected in the recent free and fair elections. Wishing Cde Mnangagwa all the best. — Cde Mzvinavhu. Twitter Response to “ZEC comes out guns blazing…‘Chamisa petition fatally and incurably defective’.” Chamisa has no prospect of success. — @Tafirenyika Response to “Zimbabwe cricket loses its Blessing.” More talent is leaving, perhaps to earn a living. Zimbabwe Cricket should wake up, future generations need something to aspire too. — @Mike. Response to “ED in Namibia for SADC talks.” Even if MDC Alliance delayed President-Elect Mnangagwa’s inauguration, the constitution allows him to attend all national events as the President. — @WilliamMonde. Website Responses to “ZEC comes out guns blazing…‘Chamisa petition fatally and incurably defective’.” Everyone knows that Chamisa had no valid case. He was trying to usurp power through the backdoor like what he did when Morgan passed on. On this one he will not win as everything is guided by the constitution. — Eliah.
