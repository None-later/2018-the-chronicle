Vice President Chiwenga EDITOR — Vice President Constantino Chiwenga is and remains spot on on all aspects of patriotic, responsive and hands-on managerial strategies. His pronouncements on local governance issues are most welcome. Local governance systems are visibly rotten and nearing total collapse. Most towns cannot provide an hour of uninterrupted water supplies, street lighting, refuse collection and sewer service. These continue to be in high demand in most residential areas across the                 country. Unashamedly, town councils have engaged debt collectors to try and siphon money out of residents yet their service delivery remains pathetic. Surely, how can they demand payment for undelivered services? Most roads have become impassable while raw sewer flows unattended. In Chegutu, we have areas like ward 4 and 5 and Hintonville locations among others, which have gone for more than 5 years with no service at all. It’s very disturbing that residents in these areas still receive outrageous bills for services they never got. It’s good that VP Chiwenga is seeing the level of rot in our local councils. These councils must prove the rates and services they say they are owed by residents. The bills must reflect the services rendered. Zimbabwe is in a new dispensation to correct wrongs of the previous regime, which exposed citizens to poverty and debts. Councils need to be realistic and improve service delivery if the “Zimbabwe is Open for Business” mantra is to be realised. We need to review all these bills to capture the true cost. Heavy reliance on estimates by councils and Zesa must stop. VP Chiwenga please come to our rescue and help councils improve service delivery. We applaud our revolutionary party which is a people’s party. Thanks aplenty. SB, Via e-mail
