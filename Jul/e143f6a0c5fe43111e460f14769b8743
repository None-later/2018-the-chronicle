Khama Billiat JOHANNESBURG — Khama Billiat has become the Absa South African Premiership soccer’s highest earner after securing his move to Kaizer Chiefs from rivals Mamelodi Sundowns. Sport24 can reveal the amount the Zimbabwean forward is earning at the Glamour Boys who wouldn’t let money stand in the way of securing his services. The 27-year-old signed a three-year contract with an option of an additional year and is reportedly earning an eye-watering R10 million a year before tax. That’s R833 333 per month. Taking the taxman into consideration — as footballers are taxed at 38 PERCENT — Billiat will be paid R515 000 a month, making him comfortably the top-earner in South Africa’s top-flight. Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane confirmed that the club could not meet Billiat’s financial demands, which prompted the star to join Chiefs. “We gave him a good offer,” Mosimane said. “Trust me, it was a big offer. The offer that we gave, he could have been the highest paid player, which would probably have taken four years for that record to be broken.” Billiat is believed to have turned down another offer — and in hindsight with good reason — from Egyptian side Zamalek who were prepared to pay him an annual salary of $450 000 (R6 050 000). By way of a comparison, Portuguese star forward Cristiano Ronaldo is set to earn a staggering R39.4 million after tax per month after sealing his move to Italian champions Juventus from Spanish giants Real Madrid on Tuesday. Ronaldo will, in fact, earn almost £73 000 a day at Juventus, with his four-year deal worth about £26m a year. The 33-year-old has joined the Italian champions from Real Madrid for £99.2m.
