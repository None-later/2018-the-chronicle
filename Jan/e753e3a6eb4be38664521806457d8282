Zinedine Zidane Real Madrid coach, Zinadine Zidane has asked Cristiano Ronaldo to focus on breaking out of his goal scoring slump as rumours of the Portuguese’s Santiago Bernabeu exit persist. The Portugal captain has scored just four goals in 14 league games this season and Los Blancos are 19 points adrift of table-topping Barcelona in La Liga. Last weekend, Zidane’s men suffered 1-0 at home defeat to Villarreal. The European Champions have been linked in recent weeks with a move for Paris Saint-German star, Neymar, with Ronaldo mentioned as the one to make way to secure a deal. The French manager, however, brushed off such speculation on Wednesday when he faced the media ahead of Madrid’s Copa del Rey first-leg clash with Leganes. Zidane said, “We know that people can talk and debate outside of the club, but we think Cristiano must just think about playing, as he has always done. “And I just want to talk about this, what he can bring to the team, that’s all. “I cannot imagine Cristiano going anywhere else. He is at his club, where he should be. Everyone loves him here. “I do not want to talk about his contract. What I am most interested in is matters on the pitch, that is what I talk to Cristiano about. Everything else he manages himself, it is not my business. “When I had difficult moments as a player I just kept working hard and thinking the team would do good things soon.”—Daily Sport
