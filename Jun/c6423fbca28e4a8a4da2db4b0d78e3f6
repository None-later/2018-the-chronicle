Lovemore Zigara in Gweru GWERU comes to a standstill tomorrow when Sheasham hosts former Premiership outfit Whawha in a high anticipated Zimbabwe General Medical Aid Fund Central Region Soccer League encounter in Mkoba. The property developers who went on a shopping spree during the off season and Whawha have been touted as the odds-on favourites to land the sole promotional ticket in the Premiership from the region. Sheasham come into this game bruised after suffering 0-2 loss to ZPC Munyati in a midweek game, a result which blew their hopes of powering to the summit of the standings. However, Jeremiah Neganda, the Sheasham gaffer said his side is up to the challenge and would want to make use of home advantage to dismantle Whawha. “We are focused on the game and we are more prepared than we did the last time against ZPC Munyati. We are looking at nothing short of victory because we cannot continue dropping points at home,” said Neganda. His counterpart Luke Petros-Jukulile is equally confident of coming out with a result. “It’s a tough match but character is always tested by such games. We also want a result so that we keep within our objectives,” Petros-Jukulile said. Another derby is in the offing this afternoon as ZPC Munyati hosts Tongogara at Munyati. The power generators will be hoping to maintain their good run after winning their last two matches since the arrival of former Chapungu coach, Tendai Chikuni. However, Tongogara coach Calvin Maphosa said he can upset the ZPC Munyati applecart by winning this afternoon’s encounter.
