THE prevailing dry spell in Bulawayo and Matabeleland provinces is expected to continue for a week, the Meteorological Services Department (MSD) has said. In a statement, the MSD said after the recent rains, southern and western parts of the country will not receive rains for at least a week. “The dry spell affecting southern and western parts of the country which are Bulawayo Metropolitan, Matabeleland North, Matabeleland South, Midlands and Masvingo provinces is expected to last for about seven days,” said the MSD in a statement. It said areas to the north of the country, mainly Manicaland, Harare and all Mashonaland provinces have chances of receiving scattered light rains. The MSD urged farmers in areas that will experience the dry spell to use the break for land preparations and weeding. “This lull in rainfall over much of the country may prolong, thus farmers in crop production areas are urged to consult their local Agricultural Extension Officers for advice on best methods of moisture conservation,” the MSD said. The general public was advised to drink lots of fluids to avoid dehydration due to rising temperatures during the day. Normal to below normal rainfall have been predicted for the 2018/2019 season. Weather experts have predicted that Zimbabwe and other Sadc countries will be affected by an El Niño induced drought this cropping season. The MSD said violent storms, prolonged dry spells, flash floods and tropical cyclones cannot be ruled out as the season progresses. — @esinathy_essira
