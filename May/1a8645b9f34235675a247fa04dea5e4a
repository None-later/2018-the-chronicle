Rutendo Makore (Left) Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter SPAIN-based striker Rutendo Makore headlines a 26-member Mighty Warriors squad called into camp for the African Women’s first-leg final round qualifier against Zambia. Coach Sithethelelwe “Kwinji 15” Sibanda announced the squad yesterday and it’s expected to go into camp today ahead of the first-leg encounter in Zambia on June 6. The return leg is set for Rufaro Stadium on June 10. Makore, the Cosafa Women’s Championship golden boot winner, has recovered from an ankle injury that kept her out of the Mighty Warriors’ 4-0 aggregate win over Namibia. Marjory Nyaumwe and Mavis Chirandu scored in the first-leg, while Emmaculate Msipha and Chirandu were on target in the return fixture. The winner of the qualifier will proceed to the finals in Ghana from November 17 to December 1. The top three teams will automatically qualify for the 2019 Fifa Women’s World Cup set for France.
