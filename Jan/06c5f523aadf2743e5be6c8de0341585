 Ricky Zililo, Sports Reporter RUGBY enthusiasts in Bulawayo are in for a treat when defending Bulawayo Metropolitan Rugby Football Board U-21 League Cup champions Old Miltonians clash with Highlanders at Hartsfield Grounds this afternoon. Both sides, tied on five points after two games, need to win today’s encounter to enhance their chances of making it to the finals set for next month. Highlanders are second on the table with a superior points difference while Old Miltonians are third. The two sides trail unbeaten Warriors, who take on winless Bulldogs this afternoon, by three points. Para Matsika, Old Miltonians coach said they are ready to take on Highlanders and they have pinned their hopes on centre players Genius Masuku and Kgosi Ndebele as well as the forwards pair of Tanaka Chikaka and Innocent Ncube. Old Miltonians will be without the services of injured flanker Daniel Nyathi. “We just have to solidify our place and hope Warriors drop points while we beat Highlanders to keep our title hopes alive. We’re ready for the game against Highlanders which I believe will be an interesting one as it’s all to play for both teams,” Matsika said. Highlanders coach Ntando Ndlovu said: “We have worked on our weaknesses and our focus now is on making sure that we go all the way to the final. We want to win this cup and the boys are raring to go.” Nqobani Ntini will captain the Highlanders outfit which has brought on board three Plumtree boys flyhalf Malvin Makhanda, Nicolas Chimbanje (flank) and scrumhalf Delight.
