GOVERNMENT has been called upon to prioritise rehabilitation of Bulawayo-Nkayi Road so as to attract investment into the district and also prevent accidents. Nkayi South Member of the National Assembly, Stars Mathe, lamented the dilapidated 158km stretch of road which has resulted in accidents. Last month alone, three buses overturned, injuring more than 50 people in Majoyi area, about 15 km from Nkayi centre. Many other accidents have gone unrecorded on the same road. Business people have also complained about the bad state of the road which they blame for high transport costs. In an interview Cde Mathe said the frequency of accidents along the road was confirmation of the poor state of the road. Government has been working on the road for a number of years and recently it completed the Mbembesi and Ngwigwizi bridges. The upgraded tarred stretch only covers less than 50km from Bulawayo. Cde Mathe said the completion of the upgrading of the road will attract investors to Nkayi district, which is endowed with hardwood, wildlife and livestock. Nkayi RDC chief executive officer Mr Zimbabwe Ndlovu said Zinara recently availed some funds for road works, which was being used to resurface a 2km stretch from Nkayi Centre to Nkayi District Hospital. “We received a disbursement of about $270 000 for our roads and work began in September,” said Mr Ndlovu .
