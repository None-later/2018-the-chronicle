Gabriel Mvumvure Collin Matiza, Harare Bureau TOP Zimbabwean sprinter Gabriel Mvumvure recently showed some resilience in the face of adversity at his base in Louisiana, United States. A few short months after representing Zimbabwe at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Mvumvure, who is now a volunteer assistant coach at  Louisiana State University, found out he was in need of a kidney transplant. Fast forward to the fall of 2017 and Mvumvure received the kidney donation from his girlfriend. His amazing journey was capped with a performance in the 100-metre dash during the Louisiana State University Alumni Gold meet on Saturday at the Bernie Moore Track and Field Stadium where he clocked a time of 11.44 seconds. And Mvumvure’s amazing comeback was described by the Louisiana State University as the “the most impressive alumni showing” during the weekend’s meet. The university tweeted on their website after the meet at the weekend: “2 years ago he realized his dream and was an Olympian. 12 months ago he needed a new kidney. 6 months ago he got one. ”Today he lined up to show the youngsters that he’s still got it. Way to go Tiger alum Gabriel Mvumvure!”
