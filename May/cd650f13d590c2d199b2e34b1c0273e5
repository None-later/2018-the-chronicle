 Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Bulawayo Chess Association (BCA) organised Africa Day open tournament gets underway at Montrose High School this morning. By noon yesterday, 110 players had registered for the competition where participants will contest in five categories; Open, Ladies, Junior A (Form 4 to 6), Junior B (Form 1 to 3) and development (Grade 7 going down). BCA spokesman Moses Mutipforo said they expect the number to rise, with most people registering just before the tournament kicks off. Late registration fees for the Open and Ladies’ events is $8, with secondary school participants paying $5, while primary school learners will fork out $3. “What is pleasing is that schools took heed of our calls to register their teams and the bulk of the 110 participants that beat the deadline are from schools. This is encouraging and it is good for the development of the sport as the youngsters get a chance to sharpen their skills by being active. There’s some excitement among schools and BCA’s efforts to create a vibrant league as well as schools’ competition are on track,” said Mutipforo. Defending Africa Day champion Phakamani Sithole from Nkulumane will have to shrug off challenges from chess masters Castro Sibanda, Kudakwashe Sibanda and Tapiwa Jele. Castro has already bagged two titles this year, the Nust Easter Open and the Independence Day Open, while Jele claimed the Hillside Open in February. ZRP’s duo of Tarcision Chikandi and Benson Chinodyanama, the Bulawayo Chess Club pair of Thabang Moyo and Russell Dzete as well as Tony Sinyanyezu and Ayanda Ndlovu of Bulawayo Polytechnic are some of the top contenders for the title that have registered. Top women’s seeds Tessa Gumirenhete of ZRP Bulawayo and Hillside’s Nomalungelo Mathe have confirmed their participation. Meanwhile, 10 players that will accumulate the most points at BCA organised competitions throughout the year will compete for the Bulawayo Championship to be held in December. — @ZililoR
