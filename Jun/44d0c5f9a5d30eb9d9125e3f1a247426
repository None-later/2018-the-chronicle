Michael Matope Business Reporter A UNITED Kingdom-based Zimbabwean entrepreneur, Mr Michael Matope, has launched a website www.Farmvest.biz, aimed at assisting farmers in the country by connecting them with potential local and foreign investors. Mr Matope, who runs UK-based Mitah Group Ltd, says the website initiative was inspired by the realisation that the demand for agriculture and agricultural products will continue to grow in response to an ever-growing world population. He says this presents a massive opportunity for growth for agriculture in Zimbabwe and eventually other countries in the region. According to the United Nations, food production must increase by over 60 percent in the next 12 years to meet with growing population demands. This presents a wonderful opportunity for Africa to benefit as it has 60 percent of the world’s arable land. The UN also points out that the agricultural sector will grow to a $1 trillion industry by 2030 from current $400 billion. “So there is a need for African farmers to take advantage this opportunity by improving farming methods, mechanising and getting access to capital,” says Matope. “Farmvest.biz has opened for registration and currently has a few projects on site but will be launching the full website with dashboard and mobile apps on the 31st July 2018. The app and website will allow investors to manage all their investments online, and allow them to invest in other projects.” He said Farmvest.biz seeks to give investors both local and in diaspora the opportunity to invest in agricultural projects mainly buying from communal and small scale farmers. Mr Matope says Farmvest.biz will connect small scale farmers with investors, who invest in cycles of between 3-5 months for poultry projects and 7-12 months for vegetables and grain projects.
