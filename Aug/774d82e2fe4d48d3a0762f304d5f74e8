 Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter PERENNIAL Southern Region Division One Soccer League campaigners — ZPC Hwange  — reignited their championship hopes when they moved into third position thereby reducing leaders Hwange’s gap by nine points following a 1-0 home win against Talen Vision on Saturday. Fanuel Shoko struck the priceless goal for the power generators in the 31st minute from the edge of the box, beating Talen Vision’s goalkeeper London Zulu as ZPC Hwange took their points tally to 28. ZPC Hwange hung on to the lead as Talen Vision threw everything at them in search of an equalizer. Talen Vision could have at least salvaged a point but they were wasteful, with striker Mlungisi Ncube being the chief culprit as he went on to miss a late penalty. With news filtering through at Ingagula that Hwange had lost their game against Toronto in Bulawayo, ZPC Hwange coach Njabulo Dube said their victory has taken them back into the championship matrix. “This is an important victory for us as it takes us back into the title race. The ultimate goal is putting a strong title challenge and I believe that we are well positioned to fight for it. What we need is to keep fighting for maximum points and ensure that we avoid dropping points so that we keep up with the leading pack,” said Dube. Despite losing the encounter, Mkhuphali Masuku, Talen Vision’s coach was happy with his charges’ performances. “Coming from the break I think we did well. It’s unfortunate that we lost the game and missing the penalty is all part of the game. I was happy with the way we maintained shape after conceding a first half goal. We came back stronger in the second half but unfortunately luck wasn’t on our side,” said Masuku. Following the defeat to ZPC Hwange, Talen Vision slipped from position four to six. Meanwhile, ex-Premiership side Tsholotsho who are second on the table with 34 points closed in on leaders Hwange and now trail the coalminers by three points following their 2-1 home victory against visiting Mosi Rovers of Victoria Falls. League debutantes Toronto did title aspirants Tsholotsho and ZPC Hwange a favour by beating Hwange and making sure that they championship race remains open. The victory over Hwange comes as a confidence booster for Toronto as they continue their relegation fight.
