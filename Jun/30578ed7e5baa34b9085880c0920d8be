President Mnangagwa Farirai Machivenyika, Harare Bureau President Emmerson Mnangagwa has called on people who will contest in the forthcoming harmonised elections to focus on issues that matter in the lives of the citizenry. “These elections will be free, fair and transparent, and the voice of the people will be heard,” he said. “I call on all candidates to conduct their campaigns peacefully and to focus on the issues that really matter. “Above all, let us remember that what unites us as Zimbabweans is far greater than anything that could ever divide us. I look forward to going out and engaging with my fellow Zimbabweans on the campaign trail.” Zanu-PF has already launched its election manifesto that has been welcomed by a cross section of society. The theme of the manifesto is “Unite, Fight Corruption, Develop, Re-engage and Create Jobs”. President Mnangagwa has promised that Government will deliver a free, fair and credible election ever since he assumed office last year. This has seen a number of regional and international observers coming into the country to assess the pre-election environment. Most of the observers have expressed confidence Zimbabwe would deliver credible elections given the steps that have been taken by Government. President Mnangagwa proclaimed July 30 as the day for the harmonised election, while the nomination courts will sit on June 14 to receive nominations for the presidential, national assembly and council elections. So far 132 political parties have registered with the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission and await processing at the nomination courts.
