Judgment Yard at Club Eden Leonard Ncube,  Victoria Falls Reporter LEADING reggae/dancehall movement – Judgement Yard from Harare will be in Victoria Falls this weekend for two back-to-back performances. Founded in 2008 in Harare, the four-member group that has acquainted itself with reggae and Zimdancehall lovers in the resort town after wowing crowds on two occasions at the Jameson Vic Falls Carnival, will be at Comfort Pub and Grill on Friday and Saturday evening.Event organiser, Nicholas Mukarati, who runs Comfort Pub and Grill, said all was in place for the two shows that are being held to wrap up the Easter Holiday. He said they wanted to promote domestic tourism through music by bringing big local acts to the resort. “Judgement Yard commands a notable following which may see some people travelling to Victoria Falls from other towns and cities for the shows,” Mukarati said. “We also want to give back to the Vic Falls community that’s been supporting our programmes by hosting big artistes.” – @ncubeleon
