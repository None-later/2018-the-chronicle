Although it was not me who contacted them, I’m sure they picked up his plight through the media and from our campaign,” he said. “I was prepared to sell my books and all my artistic products in a bid to raise the money for him. After he qualifies, this child is going to be a community doctor. A doctor that’ll serve the community he grew up in.”
