Manuel Mpofu Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter WHITE City Stadium will play host to the Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) junior and senior track and field championships on April 15. The meet is being organised by the Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) and top athletes from across the country are expected to take part. Bab chairman, Manuel Mpofu, said preparations for the meet are well on course. “We have already started preparations for the meet. This meet will be used to assess athletes for the Youth Olympics, World Junior Championships, Africa Senior Championships and the African Union Sports Council  Region Five Under-20 Youth Games,” said Mpofu. He called on schools, tertiary institutions as well as established clubs in the country to send athletes for the competition. “Last year Zimbabwe picked nine medals, including three gold at the Africa Junior Championships after sending  a team of 20 to Algeria and had one of their athletes reaching the 800m final at the World Youth meet in Kenya. The goal this year is to improve on that,” said Mpofu. Some of the athletes likely to take part will be from the team that will represent Zimbabwe in the Confederation of Schools Sport Associations of Southern Africa (Cossasa) competition in Botswana next month. Entry fees have been pegged at $2 for an event per athlete and $4 per relay team. Late registration will be $3 and Mpofu said payments can be made via EcoCash and bank transfers. Events in the offing will include 100m, 200m, 800m, 1 500m, 3 000m, 10 000m, mixed relays and the four minute mile qualifiers. Field events will include long jump, triple jump, shot-put, javelin and discus. Recently, Naaz president Tendai Tagara declared White City Stadium as the home of athletics in the country.
