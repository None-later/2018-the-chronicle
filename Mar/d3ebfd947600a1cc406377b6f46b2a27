Nyaradzo Bakari, Chronicle Reporter A CHINESE national is admitted at the United Bulawayo Hospitals after he was attacked by a sex worker after he allegedly failed to pay for her services in the city. Mr Zhao Zhong Qiang had to be rushed to the UBH for treatment after Tsitsi Mapurisa (30), from Douglasdale suburb, stoned, slapped and kicked him with booted feet last month. A court heard that Mapurisa was in the company of unidentified accomplices, who are on the run, when she allegedly attacked Mr Zhao, who is still admitted at the UBH. “I did not attack him on my own. There were other people who were assaulting him and I joined in because he had refused to pay after hiring me for sex at a bar,” she said. Mapurisa pleaded guilty to assault when she appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Franklin Mkhwananzi yesterday. The magistrate remanded her in custody to today for provision of a trial date. Prosecuting, Mr Tawurayi Hondoyemoto said Mapurisa and her accomplices who are on the run attacked Mr Zhao while he was drinking at Douglasdale Bottle Store last month. @NyarieBakie
