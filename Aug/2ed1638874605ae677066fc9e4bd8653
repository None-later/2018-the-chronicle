 Walter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent Chief Zimuto from Masvingo has died three days after his installation. He was 94. Chief Zimuto, who was buried in Zimuto village on Wednesday and born Mhumhi Mapfumo, was installed on July 24 and died on July 27. Masvingo Provincial Administrator Mr Fungai Mbetsa confirmed his death saying the province had suffered a huge loss. “I can confirm the death of our newly installed chief, Chief Zimuto. We are saddened by such a loss,” he said. Mr Mbetsa said the community of Zimuto had suffered a huge loss considering that he had just been installed. “Chief Zimuto was installed last week and in three days’ time, he was no more. He has left a governance vacuum in Zimuto community and largely in Masvingo District,” he said. Masvingo Minister of State for Provincial Affairs, Senator Josaya Hungwe also sent a condolence message to the Zimuto family. “Our hearts and indeed our thoughts are with the Mapfumo family and the rest of the Zimuto family at this difficult moment. Let me hasten to assure you that this is not your loss alone but what we have together. We therefore share in your grief,” he said. “Let us however, take comfort in the fact that this man lived a full and blessed life during which he accomplished everything that any person could wish to achieve.” Sen Hungwe urged surviving family members to be united. “Let this tragic moment not be the cause of divisions and conflict as this will only serve to retard developmental efforts. Let us therefore do everything that is necessary to ensure that there is continuity of leadership as required and provided for both by our customs and the laws of the country,” he said. Born in April 1924 in a family of five, the late chief is survived by his wife, Getrude, five children and several grand-children and great grand-children. Chief Zimuto was also a member of the Johane Masowe WeChishanu Apostolic Sect. — @walterbmswazie2
