Loud Ramakgapola Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau Government has approved Beitbridge Town Council’s $6.1 million annual budget for 2018 that will see tariffs, rates and service charges remaining at levels they were last year. In an interview last week, the town secretary, Mr Loud Ramakgapola said they had committed the bulk of the budget to capital expenditure. He said they were anticipating an income of $6.1 million. “We received the approval letter from the Minister of Local Government on January 9. Tariffs and rates remain unchanged, except for graves rates which we revised downwards after realising that the figures were not in tandem with the prevailing economic climate,” said Mr Ramakgapola. He said their parent ministry had recommended that they work extra hard to increase the revenue collection rate which presently stands at 42 percent. Mr Ramakgapola said they had lined up a number infrastructure development projects related to the town’s transformation. Some of the initiatives he said, included the construction of a new bus terminus, setting up of modern flea market stalls, upgrading Dulivhadzimo Stadium, servicing residential stands and installing public lighting. “We are also looking at constructing a new primary school to cater for our ever growing population and a market place for small to medium enterprises,” he said. The council, he said, had also set aside funds for the setting up of recreational parks and greening the town. Mr Ramakgapola said there was a need to provide quaility service and modest amenities given the fact that the border town is growing fast. He urged residents and other rate payers to service their bills to enable the council to meet its financial obligations and provide services.
