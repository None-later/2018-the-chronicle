 Richard Muponde, Plumtree Correspondent A worker at Plumtree District Hospital was found hanging in his bedroom, nearly a week after his disappearance. The body of Nathan Ngqabutho Masuku (31) of MaKariba section was discovered on Monday morning after a stench emanating from the house disturbed neighbours. Matabeleland South police spokesperson, Inspector Philisani Ndebele yesterday confirmed the incident. “We can confirm the death of a Plumtree man, Nathan Masuku (31) who committed suicide. On 4 January he visited his mother and returned on 10 January. He was last seen on that day and his brother Vusumuzi made a report of a missing person. His body was discovered in his bedroom on Monday at 7am in an advanced state of decomposition. It was conveyed to Plumtree District Hospital mortuary,” said Insp Ndebele. He said Masuku did not leave any suicide note and the reason for taking his life remains unknown. A source close to the matter however said Masuku was facing domestic and work related problems as his wife had deserted him. The source also claimed that Masuku faced investigations at work for some misdemeanours. “Nathan recently separated with his wife and she took him to court for maintenance. They were fighting just a few days before he disappeared after she indicated that she was going back to the Maintenance Court to increase the amount he was paying for her upkeep and the children,” she said. The source said at work Masuku was reportedly being investigated after items went missing. Plumtree District Medical Officer, Dr Langalokusa Sibanda dismissed allegations that Masuku had problems at work. “It’s a great loss to us as an institution. He’s a person whom we worked with for a long time. He was a young person who had great opportunities,’ said Dr Sibanda. Masuku was a well-known ‘Rastafarian’ in Plumtree town. Recently he bought a Toyota Regius mini bus and celebrated his birthday in December. @richardmuponde
