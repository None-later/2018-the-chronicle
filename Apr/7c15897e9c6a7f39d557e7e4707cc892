 Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent ZARAH Lounge opened last Friday amid pomp and fanfare with hundreds of people thronging the new joint. The opening was deliberately timed to coincide with the start of the Easter holidays when merrymakers have all the time to enjoy themselves. The pub and restaurant is located at the Lounge Nightclub courtyard that used to be the restaurant for Loungeâ€™s customers. The nightspot which opened its doors at 4PM, was packed to capacity within hours of opening as revellers came in their number to have a feel of the new bar. Sitting space was limited forcing others to stand as they enjoyed the ambience of the nightspot. The VIP area is yet to be completed so those who had come for VIP treatment had to wait for another day. The bar is a place where people can stop over and have their drinks before a night filled with partying and booze.
