 Codelia Mondela, Court Reporter A MAN from Makokoba suburb in Bulawayo allegedly took his neighbour’s ATM bank card under the pretext that he would source cash for her and swiped for groceries worth $800. A few days earlier, he allegedly snatched a cellphone from Mr Leon Ncube who was waiting for transport at Renkini bus terminus and ran away. Likwa Masuku (27) appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Gladmore Mushove facing two counts of theft. He pleaded guilty to one and pleaded not guilty to the other. The magistrate remanded him in custody to May 17 for trial. Prosecuting, Mr Kudakwashe Jaravaza said Masuku searched Mr Ncube’s pockets while he was waiting for transport at the terminus. “On December 29 last year, Masuku approached Mr Ncube and tried to take his cellphone from his trousers’ pockets but failed. Mr Ncube removed the cellphone and held it after noticing that Masuku wanted to steal it. Masuku snatched the cellphone and ran away. Masuku used Mr Ncube’s $20 which was in his EcoCash account,” the prosecutor said. It was not explained how he accessed the EcoCash account. “On January 12 this year, he informed Ms Nolwazi Ndiweni that he knew people who had cash and could get it for her. Ms Ndiweni gave him her CABS ATM card and pin code so he could withdraw cash on her behalf.” The prosecutor said after a few minutes, Ms Ndiweni received a bank message reflecting that Masuku had swiped for goods valued at $269. After an hour another message reflected that he had used $530. The court heard that he disappeared with the ATM bank card and Ms Ndiweni ended up reporting the matter to the police. @MondelaC
