Israel Rwodzi Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls THE Zimbabwe Institute of Engineers conference has resolved to establish a “think tank” of engineering experts whose task will be to provide professional advice to Government on infrastructure development. This follows President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s call last Wednesday that engineers must be in the forefront of advising Government on reforms and projects. ZIE president Engineer Israel Rwodzi said the “think tank” will be in place in six weeks’ time when a detailed document about the decision will be sent to the President. He said the “think tank” will also help curb foreign currency challenges where some projects were failing to kick off because of lack of foreign currency. “We resolved that we should take a leading role in advising Government on infrastructure development following the President’s call. “We will form a ‘think tank’ to advise Government so that when investors come it has all the required information to assist in making informed decisions,” said Eng Rwodzi. He said the issue was urgent. The engineers also resolved that they would be in constant touch with Government and be part of developmental initiatives. “There is rampant loss of foreign currency and it was resolved that there should be an infrastructure development platform, which will help reduce losses we get in terms of foreign currency requirements. The conference also resolved that engineers will assist in regularising illegal settlements countrywide by making sure that recommended standards are met. The conference which ended last Thursday, was meant to come up with strategies to enable engineers to play a leading role in the implementation of the many development projects under the new economic environment created by the new dispensation. The conference’s theme was “Accelerated Infrastructure Investment, Development and Delivery”. – @ncubeleon
