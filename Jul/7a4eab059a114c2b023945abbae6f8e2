Nkosilathi Mlalazi Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Zifa Southern Region disciplinary committee is expected to deliver a default judgment against ZRP Bulawayo goalkeeper Nkosilathi Mlalazi for assaulting a match official resulting in the abandonment of a league match last month. Mlalazi and his club arrived late for the hearing at the Zifa Southern Region offices and found members of the disciplinary committee and witnesses gone. Zifa Southern Region administrator Augustine Ndlovu confirmed ZRP Bulawayo’s absence from the hearing and said they were now waiting for the disciplinary committee to issue its judgment. The committee is made up of former Zifa administrator Stanley Ntenezi and lawyers Godwin Sengweni and Jabulani Mhlanga, who replaced Shepherd Chamunorwa after he was elevated to Zifa’s electoral committee. “The hearing for a ZRP Bulawayo player who assaulted a referee was heard at the offices on Wednesday. ZRP Bulawayo turned up about an hour after the committee was done with the hearing and we will now stand guided by the decision of the disciplinary committee,” said Ndlovu. Mlalazi faces a lengthy ban for assaulting referee Saidi Phiri during his team’s Southern Region Division One league match against Talen Vision last month at Ross Camp ground. Mlalazi stormed onto the field from the terraces and struck Saidi on the back of his head after Vision scored a late goal through Dingani Maphosa. The goalkeeper had been red-carded in the 72nd minute for a crude lunge on Maphosa. The attack on the referee was captured on video by Bulawayo-based freelance journalist, Thandazani Zimbwa. Zifa Southern Region chairman Musa Mandaza declared then that appropriate action would be taken against Mlalazi for his violent behaviour. In 2016, Zifa Southern slapped Victoria Falls Tigers defender Lethukuthula Mathe with a 10-year ban for assaulting referee Bekezela Makeka during a Division One league derby against Amagagasi. — @ZililoR
