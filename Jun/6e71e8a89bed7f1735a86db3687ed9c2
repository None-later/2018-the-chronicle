Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter DOMESTIC and commercial gas supplier Value Gas this week donated a full set of playing kits to one of the top darts clubs in the city, Archers, as part of its social responsibility. Value Gas managing director Maurice Masike said they were proud to be associated with a well organised team driven by the zeal to succeed. “If you remember we sponsored the same team last year and they went on to do well in the Bulawayo Metropolitan Darts Association League as well as other invitational tournaments outside the City and we therefore did not hesitate to come on board again this year. We are proud to be associated with such a successful team because as a company that is our motto as well. We have grown remarkably since last year with branches in Matabeleland, Manicaland and Mashonaland provinces and we continue exploring potential markets,” said Masike. Archers liaison officer Ernest “Maphepha” Sibanda paid tribute to Value Gas for the kind gesture. “Despite what we can say is a very volatile operating environment, Value Gas has seen it fit to pour back to the community and we are the recipients as Archers Darts Club. Value Gas is a success driven company just like us, hence we declare our intention to win the Bulawayo league title this year. We have a team of young and ambitious players that have what it takes to make us realise this dream and we really want to thank Value Gas for deciding to be part of this dream,” said Sibanda. Archers already has silverware in its trophy cabinet after coming out tops in the Matabeleland South Darts Association competition that was held at Stanmore Business Centre.
