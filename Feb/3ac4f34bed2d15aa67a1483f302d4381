 Codelia Mondela, Court Reporter A WOMAN from Makokoba suburb in Bulawayo has appeared in court for allegedly terminating her pregnancy unlawfully. Xola Sibanda (21) was reported to the police by her cousin Nkanyiso Bhebhe who discovered a foetus inside a plastic bag while he was cleaning the room he shares with her.  Sibanda was not asked to plead to a charge of unlawful termination of pregnancy before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Franklin Mkhwananzi. Mr Mkhwananzi remanded her in custody to February 12 for trial. Prosecuting, Mr Maclean Ndlovu alleged that on January 6 this year at around 6AM, Bhebhe left Sibanda sleeping at home. He said when he returned at around 1PM, she was still sleeping. “Sibanda asked her cousin to send a WhatsApp message to her friend Silethemba Nkomo informing her that she was not feeling well. After an hour, Silethemba arrived and the two left the house,” Mr Ndlovu said. “Bhebhe started cleaning the room which he shares with Sibanda and discovered a folded blanket on the floor. There were also blood stained clothes in a black plastic bag. He called an elderly neighbour. The two opened the plastic bag and found a foetus.” Last week, a woman from Pumula East suburb appeared in court after she allegedly drowned her one-month-old baby in Umguza River in the presence of her one-year-old daughter. Taboka Nkomo (21) was not asked to plead to infanticide when she appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Franklin Mkhwananzi. The magistrate granted her $50 bail and remanded the matter to February 12. @MondelaC
