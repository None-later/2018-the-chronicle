Nqobile Sibanda, Sports Reporter HWANGE FC and Mosi Rovers FC have stepped up their preparations for the Southern Region Division One League campaign with a pre-season three-team invitational tournament today. The other team that will feature at today’s mini-festival to be held at Victoria Falls’ Chinotimba Stadium is Livingstone Pirates of Zambia. Mosi Rovers chairman, Mubita Mwanda, said the matches are meant to afford participants to fine-tune their squads ahead of the season’s start. The league starts on April 7. “We have organised a match with Livingstone Pirates of Zambia which we will co-host with Hwange FC in preparation for the season. As Mosi Rovers, we are aiming at gaining promotion into the Premier Soccer League. We are now ready to compete with our opponents,” said Mwanda. Mosi Rovers will bank on the experience of defensive midfielder Blessing Sunday who has played for Hwange, Black Rhinos and has had stints in Swaziland. The team also roped in some players from relegated Amagagasi. Mosi Rovers has also lined a friendly with newly promoted NRZ Leopards of Dete who got the nod after Lunda FC of Binga failed to affiliate. Coached by Phumulo “Kanu” Mathe, Mosi Rovers is the only Division One side from Victoria Falls following the demise of Trumus, Amagagasi and Sao Paulo. — @nqoesibanda82
