Walter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent THE Zion Christian Church (ZCC) has gone a gear up in preparing for this year’s Easter Conference at Mbungo in Bikita where more than 100 000 congregates from across the world are expected to converge. Speaking to The Chronicle yesterday, ZCC spokesperson Mr Raymond Muringani said preparations for the annual pilgrimage were at an advanced stage. He said as a precursor to the conference, the church had Children’s Ministry on Saturday before a Palm Sunday ceremony held yesterday across the country. The Easter Holiday starts on Friday and ends on Monday. “We have started preparing for one of the big events on the calendar of Christians, the Easter conference. We expect in excess of 100 000 congregates from across the world to attend,” said Mr Muringani. He said congregates were expected to troop to Mbungo on Good Friday, the day of the church council meetings and on Saturday Bishop Dr Nehemiah Mutendi will give his first sermon of the Easter conference. He said Bishop Dr Mutendi will preach the main sermon, based on the resurrection of Jesus Christ, on Sunday, after a procession in the morning. “Our main days are Saturday and Sunday when Bishop Dr Mutendi will preach. “We invite all across the country, even the non-congregates, to come and witness the power of the Holy spirit and our bishop’s God given wisdom,” he said. Mr Muringani said the Easter conference serves as a flagship of all ZCC gatherings as congregates across the world get a rare opportunity to hear Bishop Dr Mutendi preaching. Religious organisations around the country are also preparing to hold similar gatherings at different venues to observe the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ. —@walterbmswazie3
