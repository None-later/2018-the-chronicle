Reuben Kumpasa Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter MATABELELAND Warriors’ dream of playing at the South African Gold Cup came to a brutal end following an 8-57 thrashing by Harare Sports Club (HSC) on Saturday. Harare Sports Club will now represent Zimbabwe at the tournament, which is a club competition for league champions from different African countries. Old Georgians have represented Zimbabwe in the South African Gold Cup for the past two years. Matabeleland Warriors coach Rueben Kumpasa bemoaned lack of regular competitive action as the major factor to his side playing second fiddle to the Harare side. “We started the game very slow and the boys looked very tired and that is how we lost the game. At halftime we were already trailing 45-5. It was a much better second half from the boys, but it was rather too late. I believe the biggest problem is that we do not play regular competitive rugby and it has showed on numerous occasions that our boys lack game time when we go into matches of this calibre. I believe the more we play competitive games, the better we will get in terms of the quality,” Kumpasa said. In another game played on the same day, Falcon College lost 17-20 to St George’s College.
