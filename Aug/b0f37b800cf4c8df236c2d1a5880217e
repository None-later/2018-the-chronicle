Sukoluhle Ndlovu, Midlands Correspondent ABOUT 90 percent of exhibition space for the annual Midlands Show to be held in Gweru next week, has been taken up. The show which will run from 16 to 19 August, is expected to attract about 30 000 visitors. Midlands Show Society chairperson, Mr Augustine Mupakurirwa said preparations were at an advanced stage and about 90 percent of available stands had already been booked. The show which this year will be officially opened by Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement Minister Perrance Shiri, is running under the theme, “Steering the economy to vibrancy.” Mr Mupakurirwa said this year’s show was delayed by the harmonised elections which were held on July 30. He said 180 exhibitors had by yesterday confirmed their participation and 18 of them were exhibiting for the first time. Mr Mupakurirwa said the society was yet to confirm whether or not there will be cattle exhibition this year following outbreaks of the deadly foot and mouth disease in the province.
