 Sylvester Chiramba, Court Reporter A 36-YEAR-OLD man from Bulawayo has been arrested for allegedly trying to rape a three-year-old baby in Lobengula West. Sobusa Ngwenya from Lobengula West suburb allegedly grabbed the baby who cannot be named for ethical reasons while she was playing outside their house and took her to a nearby trench where he attempted to rape her, on Saturday last week. Ngwenya appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Lungile Ncube charged with attempted rape. He was not asked to plead and was remanded in custody to January 30 pending a mental examination. Ngwenya told the court that he had no idea why he had been arrested. “I do not know why they arrested me. All I did was talk to the little girl while I was in the trench. She was playing close to where I was sitting,” he said. Prosecuting, Mr Petros Shoko said on Saturday at around 5PM the girl was playing at the gate when Ngwenya came and lifted her up. “He went with her to a trench near the house where he removed the juvenile’s panties and attempted to have sexual intercourse with her,” said Mr Shoko. “His failed attempt at raping the girl resulted in him smearing his semen on the girl’s undergarment and left thigh. Ngwenya then fled the scene when he saw the complainant’s father approaching.” In a police statement, the victim’s father said that he was leaving for work when his wife told him that their daughter was under attack. “I ran to her rescue only to realise that my daughter had been placed by the accused person on his thigh. As I ran towards them the accused person then saw me, put my daughter on the ground and ran away,” reads the statement. The court heard that the victim’s father unsuccessfully tried to chase after Ngwenya before reporting the matter at Magwegwe Police Station. It was not revealed how police eventually arrested Ngwenya. — @SlyCee10.
