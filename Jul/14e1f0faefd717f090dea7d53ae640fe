Ndumiso Gumede Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Highlanders’ board of directors’ post will no longer be a lifetime position, with incumbents now expected to serve for a maximum of 10 years, board chairman Luke Mnkandla has said. Mnkandla made the announcement to members at the club’s mid-year review meeting held at the clubhouse on Sunday during which two more board members were inducted into the system and two other nominees were rejected. Former club chairmen Ndumiso Gumede and Peter Dube were confirmed as new board members, while Nicholas Nyathi and Methuseli Mafu were recommended for executive committee positions. Highlanders’ members will vote for the club’s vice-chairman and treasurer next year, as the incumbents Modern Ngwenya and Donald Ndebele’s terms will be ending. “It was recently agreed that we will no longer hold office forever as your board, but will be here for a maximum of 10 years and have others coming in,” said Mnkandla. The appointment of new board members filled vacancies created by the resignation of Davies Sibanda, Devine Ngwenya and Thomas Ngwenya. “Kusinwa kudedelwana bakithi (we must give others a chance) and I have decided to stand aside and let others do the job,” Thomas Ngwenya said in a brief and emotional farewell to members on Sunday. While there is now a cap on term limits for board members, Chronicle Sport has it on good authority that all but one board member was in agreement with the new status quo. As a result of the new requirement, former board vice-chairman Jonathan Saying Moyo and former board chairman Mgcini Nkolomi could be serving their last few months in office. The board recently made positional changes with Mnkandla assuming the board chairmanship, while human resources guru Cosmos Sikhosana is his deputy. Matthew Sibindi holds the board secretary post.
