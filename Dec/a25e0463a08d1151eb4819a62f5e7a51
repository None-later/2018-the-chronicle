THE Tourism Business Council of Zimbabwe (TBCZ) has appointed Ms Winnie Muchanyuka as its new president, replacing Mr Tich Hwingwiri. Ms Muchanyuka was the vice-president of the Zimbabwe Council of Tourism (ZCT) for the past three years before the organisation was rebranded into TBCZ in September this year. “TBCZ would like to congratulate Winnie Muchanyuka for being elected the new president of council. May the new appointment be a source of success for the tourism industry. The council is in great hands. Congratulations,” the council posted on its official Twitter handle. The ZCT was formed in 1988, with the objective of championing interests of tourism players through the creation of an environment in which it is possible for operators to maintain and grow their businesses for the benefit of the economy. Ms Muchanyuka holds an MSc Degree in Tourism and Hospitality Management from the University of Zimbabwe and is studying towards a PhD in Tourism Management focusing on tourism development in Southern Africa. Her study looks specifically at ways of growing tourist arrivals through increased airline access and intra-regional connectivity. Ms Muchanyuka’s career in the sector spans over 26 years. She started working for Air Zimbabwe before moving to the group of Swissair, Austrian Airlines and Sabena and finally at South African Airways where she is the country manager since 2007. She has also worked as chairperson of the International Air Transport Association and a local carrier advisory group.
