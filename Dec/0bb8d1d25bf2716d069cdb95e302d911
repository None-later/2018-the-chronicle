TAKING the Made in Bulawayo Concert (MIB) to the high density suburb of Luveve in Bulawayo seems to have been a wise move as this platform unearthed some hidden talent. The third instalment of the annual hip hop showcase spearheaded by Cal Vin was held at the Luveve Beit Hall last Saturday. Relatively unheralded artistes such as GTi, Thebza, dance crew Crazy Masters, Luchi Shiki and CMK were a revelation on stage. The known acts such as Mawiza, Floppy X and Msiz’Kay were also a marvel to watch. Looking back at the event, Cal Vin said he was impressed with performances of the up-and-coming acts. “Everyone was on fire. They brought the heat on stage and I was really impressed. I came up with the MIB concept to give a platform to up-and-coming artistes to showcase their talent and I’m glad that they used that opportunity well as evidenced by what I saw on stage,” said Cal Vin. He said everything went well on the night, although he felt they could have done more on the marketing of the concert. “The production was good. We managed to tie loose ends and those problems from last year (poor sound and lighting) didn’t come back to haunt us. However, I think we could’ve done more to market the show because I wasn’t happy with the numbers. “That’s next year’s task,” said Cal Vin. As a way to build an audience for next year’s edition of MIB, Cal Vin said they would hold shows around the high density suburbs. “In 2019 we shall do the MIB concert in December again but we want to hold build up events called Community Halls Gcwalisa. These events will be held every two months in every ghetto neighbourhood. “These events will feed into the Made in Bulawayo concert at the end of next year.”
