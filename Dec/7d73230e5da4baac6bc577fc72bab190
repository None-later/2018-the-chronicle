The two DJs who specialise in deep house music were a hit in their prime during their days at Hartsfield Tshisanyama. With Liz on the decks and Crazy Black on the mic, the two worked wonders and were always a marvel. They however went their separate ways after the temporary closure of Tshisanyama last year.

We’ve great chemistry with Crazy Black and it’s always a pleasure working with him,” said DJ Liz. She said she had a new set which people should come and experience at the party.
