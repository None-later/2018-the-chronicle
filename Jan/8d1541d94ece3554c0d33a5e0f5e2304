Tembo Chuma Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS have appointed Tembo Chuma as their new goalkeepers’ coach. Chuma takes over from club legend Peter Nkomo, who was in charge in the second half of the 2017 season following the demotion of Cosmas “Tsano” Zulu to the juniors. The widely travelled Chuma re-joins Bosso on a three-year deal. His first stint with the black-and-white army was from 2012-2013 when he joined from Masvingo United and led the club’s goalkeepers Ariel Sibanda and Munyaradzi Diya to the prestigious Castle Lager Soccer Stars of the Year calendar. Chuma is a Caf B coaching badge holder, who has also had stints with ZPC Kariba and Triangle United. In a statement yesterday, Highlanders said Chuma begins work with immediate effect. “Highlanders FC wish to confirm that Tembo Chuma has been appointed as the Highlanders FC goalkeepers’ coach. He signed a three-year contract with the club and will commence working with the technical team today 29 January 2018,” read the statement. Chuma was part of the Warriors’ interim technical team comprising FC Platinum gaffer Norman Mapeza, Mandla Mpofu and Tonderai Ndiraya of Ngezi Platinum Stars last year. He joins the Bosso technical team led by technical manager Madinda Ndlovu, with Mpofu as the first team coach. Melusi “Mabaleka” Sibanda is the developmental side coach and will be assisted by Gift Lunga Jr, who also remains the Under-18 head coach. Sizabantu Khoza will take charge of the Under-16s, while the Under-14s will be coached by Daniel Ngwenya. Smart Moyo is the juniors’ manager, with Marko Dube as the developmental side manager. The medical department will be headed by Hillary Tshuma, with the long-serving Loyal Nyika remaining as physiotherapist. @innocentskizoe
