Tendai Ndoro ZIMBABWE international Tendai Ndoro returned to South Africa’s Premier Soccer League with a bang as he scored on debut for Ajax Cape Town in their 3-1 victory over fellow strugglers Platinum Stars that moves the club off the foot of the table. Ndoro is back in the PSL six months after leaving Orlando Pirates and following a disappointing spell in Saudi Arabia with Al-Faisaly. He netted the third goal in the crucial victory for the home side after a first career strike for Tercious Malepe and a wonder-goal from Tashreeq Morris had seen Ajax come from behind to seal the points. Stars had taken the lead through a debutant of their own, Zama Ramabuwane, who had only joined the club on loan from SuperSport United 24 hours before. It was also the first career goal for the 20-year-old. Stars had controlled much of the first half before Ramabuwane headed them in front, meeting an inviting cross from Vuyo Mere at the back post. It took until the hour-mark for Ajax to really build-up momentum and found an equaliser when Malepe completed a tap-in after Samuel Julies’ shot had hit the post and fallen kindly for him. The home side then hit the front with eight minutes remaining as Morris made the sweetest of connections on the edge of the box and rifled the ball into the back of the net. Ajax’s fine night was completed in injury-time when the hardworking Ndoro was rewarded for his efforts, latching onto a through-ball to easily beat the Stars keeper. The result drops league champions BidVest Wits back to the bottom of the table, with Stars falling into the relegation play-off position and Ajax moving up to 13th. In another league clash on Friday night, Maritzburg United moved into fourth place with a thumping 4-0 home victory over Bloemfontein Celtic. Maritzburg led 1-0 at the break thanks to a goal from Pogiso Sanoka, before Mohau Mokate, Andrea Fileccia and Evans Rusike added further strikes in the second half. – KweséESPN
