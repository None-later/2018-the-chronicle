 Takudzwa Chitsiga,Harare Bureau ZIMBABWE Open Golf Committee tournament organising chairperson Michael Mahachi said a record pre-qualifying field will converge at Royal Harare this morning. The Old Mutual Zimbabwe Open is ranked among the top five tournaments in Africa outside the European Tour co-sanctioned tournaments. Sponsored to the tune of R2 million the event will see 96 professional golfers coming on board for the eight slots which will be filled on by end of today. “We have the biggest field ever for this qualifier with 96 players expected for the eight slots. This is the highest number of qualifiers since 2010 and it heightens the interest in the Zimbabwe open. “The course is looking good after the recent rains and the rough will present its usual challenges at Royal Harare. The Open Committee has arranged free entertainment for kids on Saturday and Sunday,” said Mahachi. Last year top amateur, Arnold Burasho, who is representing the country at this year’s Region V at Chapman was the surprise package as he managed to make the cut. The player carded a one-under 71 in the pre-qualifiers at Royal Harare. The top amateur was playing off one handicap in which 50 professionals fought for the last top eight slots for the finals. Burasho formerly of Norton Country Club joined Mairos Katembenuka a professional to be the only local who managed to make it as the other six slots were taken by South Africans. For the third time in a row, the qualifiers will be held at Royal Harare.
