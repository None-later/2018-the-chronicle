 Andile Tshuma, Chronicle Reporter POLICE in Bulawayo have banned the carrying of dangerous weapons in the city following a series of violent crimes involving the weapons recorded recently. The ban is set to be in place for the next three months after coming into effect on Wednesday. The ban has been issued in terms of the Public Order and Security Act (Posa). The Officer Commanding Bulawayo West District, Chief Superintendent Marshal Dube, said police had banned the use of and display of dangerous weapons in public. “We believe that on reasonable grounds, that the carrying in public whether openly or in concealment of any weapons or items capable to be used such as catapults, machetes, axes, knobkerries, knives, swords or daggers be prohibited with effect from July 11, 2018,” he said in a statement. Police also banned the carrying of traditional weapons which could cause public disorder and despondency. “Any traditional weapon whatsoever which is likely to occasion public disorder or a breach of the peace (I) hereby issue an order prohibiting the carrying of such weapons in the area or any part for a period not exceeding three months,” said Chief Supt Dube. The Officer Commanding Bulawayo Suburban district, Superintendent Dario Mapiye, said the prohibition of these weapons in public was in response to an upsurge in violent crimes often committed using the listed weapons. “The reason for prohibition follows an anticipated upsurge in crime involving the element of violence such as murder, assaults, malicious damage to property and kidnapping n Bulawayo,” he said. Police said failure to comply with the prohibition order was a criminal offence which could see offenders spending up to six months in prison.—@andile_tshuma
