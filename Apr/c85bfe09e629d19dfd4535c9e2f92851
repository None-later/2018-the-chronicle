 Nyaradzo Bakari, Chronicle Reporter A PROMINENT Bulawayo DJ has been dragged to the maintenance court by his girlfriend for the upkeep of their nine-month-old daughter. Banele Thabiso Mbuya (popularly known as Kead Wikead), a DJ at Club Connect, yesterday offered to pay $100 for the upkeep of a daughter he sired with Ms Vanessa Simangele Msoni. In his offer, the award-winning DJ was in agreement with the amount that Ms Msoni was demanding before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Collen Chiruma. Ms Msoni told the court that she wanted $100 from Kead because her salary was not enough to cover her and the child’s expenses. “I am employed at Club 09 and I only earn $100 a month. I do not live with him so I shoulder all expenses,’ she told the court. According to State papers, Msoni said she also needs the money to hire a maid to look after the baby while she is at work. The magistrate ordered Mbuya to pay $100, effective this month. “The Respondent is to pay $100 towards the upkeep of the child. This money is to be deposited into the applicant’s account starting this month,” said MrChiruma. — @NyarieBaki
