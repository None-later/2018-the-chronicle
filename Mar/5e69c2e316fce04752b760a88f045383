Modern Ngwenya Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS vice chairman Modern Ngwenya cheated death on Monday evening when he was involved in a road traffic accident just after Chegutu on his way to Harare for a meeting. The car Ngwenya was driving was extensively damaged but he escaped unscathed after ramming into a pirate taxi that suddenly stopped in front of him to pick up passengers. Ngwenya said he suspected the driver of the pirate taxi was either drunk or unlicenced, as he bolted out of the vehicle and fled after the accident. “I almost died, just like that. A drunkard, unlicenced or reckless driver applied emergency brakes in front of me in the middle of the road instead of moving off the road and I ploughed into him,” said Ngwenya. He said there was almost a pile up as the vehicle immediately behind him almost crashed into his car, but the driver managed to veer off the road, although it was hit by oncoming traffic. “The car behind tried to avoid me and veered off the road, but it was hit by an oncoming truck. The culprit ran away before police could attend the accident scene. It was scary and I later leant that the area is actually a dark spot as a number of accidents have occurred there,” said Ngwenya. The mishap happened on the same day that Caps United captain Hardlife Zvirekwi was amputated just above the left wrist after his palm was crushed in a car accident. Zvirekwi was on his way home from a function at Motor Action Sports Club. @skhumoyo2000
