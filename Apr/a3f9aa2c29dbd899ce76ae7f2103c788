Cassper Nyovest has spilled the tea on why fans have been waiting for what seems like a lifetime for his Family Tree artistes to drop albums. The label’s biggest musos‚ including Nadia Nakai and Tshego‚ have been there for over two years and only have a few singles to show for their efforts‚ leading to some fans wondering if “papa Cass” was neglecting his artistes. A fan had inquired why there was no new music from Cassper’s artistes. “I’m super worried about Tshego and Nadia honestly. Tshego’s album has been ready since two years ago and at one stage, he had everyone’s attention, but still no album dropped, not even a mixtape. Nadia looks ready to release an album but I know she won’t drop. What’s actually going on?” quizzed the follower. Cassper responded: “Tshego’s house was broken into and they took everything. He had to start from scratch. Nadia’s album was weak so I told her to start again and the first record she made was Naa’mean.” He said people needed to be patient as good music takes time to produce. “Y’all like to rush artistes only for them to drop albums that nobody buys. We got this, chill!” Cassper further defended Nadia telling trolls that her latest music has the same flows as Cardi B. – Sowetan
