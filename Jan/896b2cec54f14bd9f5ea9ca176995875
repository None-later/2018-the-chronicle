 Lovemore Zigara in Gweru CHAPUNGU have made changes to their executive committee, with Group Captain Pious Maketo being named as the new chairman. Maketo, who was an ex-officio member of the executive, has taken over from Hillary Jona, who has been reassigned due to work commitments. Maketo will be deputised by Patrick Chikwanda, former chairman of the now defunct former Premiership side Hardbody while Mkhululi Dube has been retained as club secretary. Tawanda Zowa bounces back as public relations officer, with Charles Chikwira being named club administrator. Other members of the new executive are Patience Nyoni (treasurer), Lizwe Mahlangu (chief security officer), Martin Mungofa and Edward Ganyani (board member marketing), Onesimo Gumbu and George Manyumbu and former team manager Elvis Shumba, who is now the board member for development. Zowa said the changes were necessitated by the redeployment of Jona, which saw the new boss being given the green light to choose members of his board. “We now have a new governor, Group Captain Pius Maketo, who has taken over from Squadron Leader Hillary Jona, who has been redeployed elsewhere by the Air Force of Zimbabwe. We want to thank him for the services he rendered to Chapungu and we wish him well in his endeavours,” said Zowa. “The new governor chose his team and we are confident in his abilities that he will steer the Chapungu ship to dizzy heights. This year we are targeting a top four finish and we have no doubt that it can be achieved,” he said. Chapungu finished 11th in 2017, missing their targeted top eight finish they had set themselves at the beginning of the season. — @lavuzigara1
