 Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Gwanda Correspondent A SIXTY-YEAR-OLD man has been arrested after he raped a 17-year-old girl in exchange of a job. Phillip Mpofu of Habane Township in Esigodini offered the teenager, who stays in Bulawayo, a job as a shopkeeper. He then told her that she had to sleep with him if she wanted to keep the job. She refused and he raped her. Mpofu was not asked to plead when he appeared before Gwanda regional magistrate, Mr Mark Dzira. He was remanded in custody but the matter will kick off on a date to be advised after witnesses failed to turn up in court. Prosecuting, Mr Mncedisi Dube said Mpofu raped the juvenile on May 25. “The teenager called her aunt from Esigodini area and told her that she was looking for a job. The aunt then gave Mpofu the complainant’s cell phone number after he told her that he was looking for a shopkeeper. “On 25 May the teenager called Mpofu who advised her to board a bus to Esigodini area for employment. Mpofu met the complainant at the bus stop and paid her busfare. He led her to his tuckshop and showed her where she was going to work,” said Mr Dube. He said around at around 8PM Mpofu took the teenager to his home and told her that she was going to spend the night there. Mpofu then told her that he was going to give her the job on condition that she had sexual intercourse with him but she refused. He then demanded back the money that he had paid for the teenager’s busfare. Mr Dube said the teenager pointed out that she did not have any money and Mpofu pushed her to the ground and threatened to shoot her with a gun if she made any noise and he raped her. Mr Dube said the teenager spent the night in Mpofu’s house and on the following morning she reported the matter resulting in his arrest. — @DubeMatutu
