Flying Bantu on stage in Victoria Falls Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter MUSIC lovers in Victoria Falls were treated to a memorable Easter holiday with well organised shows that were held around the resort town. While some spent theirs at Easter conferences, vigils and all night prayers between Thursday and yesterday, others were kicking it out at various nightspots, thereby igniting the town’s nightlife. The action started on Friday at Comfort Pub and Grill with local DJs on the turntables. Saturday was also fun filled at the same venue although a Zimdancehall artiste from Harare, Silent Killer failed to make it, leaving local DJs to entertain a fully packed house. Proprietor of the nightspot Nicholas Mukarati had also organised a two-day Chinotimba Sports Bar Social Soccer Tournament which ended yesterday to spark the holidays. Five teams-four from Victoria Falls and one from Harare took part. At Chinotimba Old Bar, it was a memorable weekend for the “old madalas” as Victoria Falls’ own Kwejani Band fronted by Sizwangendaba Ncube played for two nights. Away from the ghetto, the elite were grooving and eating large at Zambezi House. Multi award winning DJ Stavo played at the spot on Friday before a Tshisa Nyama and market day was held on Saturday which culminated into a memorable double header featuring Victoria Falls’ own Flying Bantu and Harare’s Evicted at night. On Saturday night, even a technical fault on the PA system could not dampen the morale as the two boy bands gave their best at Zambezi House. In Bulawayo, it felt like Christmas as party lovers thronged various nightspots from Thursday to celebrate Easter and the long weekend. Spots such as Red Café, Cosmopolitan, Shisha and the newly opened Zarah Lounge were packed to the rafters. @ncubeleon
