Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter CASTLE Lager Premier Soccer League side Bulawayo City is considering using White City Stadium as its new home ground for the 2018 season after struggling to get results at Barbourfields Stadium last season. Tsholotsho FC were the last team to use White City Stadium as their home ground in 2016, but the Zifa grounds committee condemned the pitch ahead of the 2017 season, resulting in the stadium not hosting any topflight action last season. The Bulawayo City Council revealed that it would resurface the pitch to meet international standards. City chief executive officer Mackenzie Moyo said it was key for the team to have its own base. “We are still discussing on the issue of the stadium. If all goes according to our plans, we should be moving to White City Stadium. I believe we should start where we can cultivate our own support base then as we grow, we can think about Barbourfields Stadium. Highlanders already have their base at Barbourfields and the community around there and we cannot dislodge them. Luveve Stadium is oversubscribed with the number of teams that play there, so White City is an option for us to start our own thing,” said Moyo. “We have been trying to tell people what it means to have a football team. It’s not that we are into football for the money, but it is the community that should benefit instead. We want to engage some youngsters from Bulawayo that will give them employment. We will also add to what other teams have been doing, which is domestic tourism,” he said. The City executive committee held a two-day strategic planning workshop at the weekend aimed at underlining the season’s objectives as well as how to grow the club’s brand. @innocentskizoe
