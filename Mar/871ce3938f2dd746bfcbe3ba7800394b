Farai Nyandoro Sports Reporter THE Bulawayo Provincial Pool Association has set up two district leagues in compliance with the Sports and Recreation Commission’s (SRC) directive to spread the sport. The province will now have three leagues — the topflight, Bulawayo Central District and the Mzilikazi District. Farai Nyandoro, the association’s marketing and publicity secretary said the top two teams from the Mzilikazi and Bulawayo Central district leagues will be promoted into the topflight at the end of the season. The topflight — Bulawayo Provincial Pool League —starts today. “This will be our first year under the new SRC and Sports Ministry’s statutes which encouraged broadening the sport to ensure that pool is played competitively across the city. We have since submitted our constitution to the SRC. “Our topflight has changed from Premiership and will be known as the Bulawayo Provincial Pool League. We hope the teams coming from the districts will be as competitive as those in the topflight league,” said Nyandoro. Entumbane are the defending champions and begin the season as favourites. The champions will be aiming at continuing with their dominance as they hunt for a third successive title.
