Meynard Moyo Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE National Darts Association of Zimbabwe (Ndaz) has named an 18-member team that will represent the country at the African Union Sports Council Region 5 Darts championship in Malawi next month. The team is led by veteran darts master David Nyemba from Mashonaland West province who carries the nation’s hopes at the tournament where eight countries have confirmed participation. “The tournament will be held at Lake Malawi from August 27-31. So far eight countries, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi have confirmed participation. South Africa are the defending champions. We expect Team Zimbabwe to leave on August 25,” said Ndaz president Meynard Moyo. He said he was expecting a tough tournament, but was optimistic the selected players will stand their own and probably wrestle the title from their southern neighbours, noting that the team is busy with its preparations. “We expect a tough tournament, although I feel we have a strong squad to win the tournament,” said Moyo. The selected players were chosen at the recently held Zimbabwe darts trials at Munyati. Also in the team are four promising youngsters, who include the Matabeleland South duo of Brandon Ncube and Siphindile Moyo, who are learners at Gwanda High School.
