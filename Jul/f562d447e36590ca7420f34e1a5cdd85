Priscilla Chigumba Justice Priscilla Chigumba I don’t see anything wrong in assuring a free and fair election. If Zec is trying to reach the world standards, they should be applauded for a job well done. The fair play will root out the rhetoric of election legitimacy. Above all, it will make Zimbabweans proud wherever they are, on how good they handle their matters. I say well done to Justice Priscilla Chigumba and Zec as a whole. — Garamombe
