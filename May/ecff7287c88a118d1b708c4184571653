 Yemurai Ushamba, Chronicle Reporter A SOLDIER from Mbalabala has offered $50 for the upkeep of his minor child. Ndandatho Mpofu was dragged to the Maintenance Court by Ms Thandoyenkosi Ngwenya who was demanding $135 for the upkeep of their five-year-old child. Ms Ngwenya said that Mpofu earned $435 a month. “I am requesting for $135 for the upkeep of my child. I know he can afford it because he earns $435 a month,” she said. Mpofu offered $50 for the upkeep of his child. “I get a net salary of $322 a month because I took loans that I am still paying for. I cannot afford $135. I can afford to contribute $50 towards the child’s upkeep,” he said. Ms Ngwenya rejected the $50 offer. “Your worship $50 is too little. I can use that money to buy the child’s groceries. I am unemployed and the child needs school fees and uniforms. He has to offer more than this. I have been taking care of his child with the help of my family,” she said. Bulawayo magistrate Mr Sheunesu Matova ordered Mpofu to pay $70 for the upkeep of one minor child. “You are hereby ordered to pay $70 for the upkeep of one minor child until the child attains 18 years or is self sufficient,” he said. Meanwhile, a salesman  at Lip Gas Company in Bulawayo has offered $60 for the upkeep of his three minor children. Themba Mpofu was dragged to the Maintenance Court by his ex-wife Ms Belinda Sithole for child support. Mpofu appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Sheunesu Matova and offered $60 for the upkeep of three minor children aged seven, eight and 10-years-old. Mpofu said he could not afford $150 since his earnings were too little. “I am employed at Lip Gas Company and I sell gas. I earn $200 a month. I have other expenses such as rent and transport. I cannot afford to pay $150 a month because my monthly payment is insufficient,” he said. Sithole had approached the court demanding $150 for the upkeep of three minor children. “He is not supporting the children. I am a hairdresser and I realise around $50 a month. I am struggling with the children on my own without the help of their father. $60 is not enough for three children considering they are going to school. That means each child will get $20. Where will I get the school fees when the money he is offering is not even sufficient for groceries,” she said. Mr Matova ordered Mpofu to pay $90 a month for the upkeep of three minor children. “She is right $60 is not enough for three children. You are hereby ordered to pay $90 a month for the upkeep of three minor children until they are 18 years or are self sufficient,” he said. @YUshamba
