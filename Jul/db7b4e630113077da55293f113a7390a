Members of Bosso Bulletin Supporters’ Group pose with ball-boys after donating a kit to the boys at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday Descent Dube, Sports Reporter BOSSO Bulletin Supporters’ Group donated a full kit to Highlanders’ ball-boys at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday. The supporters group presented the kit to the ball-boys before the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League encounter between Highlanders and Herentals, which the home team won 1-0. Bosso Bulletin Supporters’ Group spokesperson, Mojalifa Mokoele Ndlovu, said they mobilised funds to purchase the kit through WhatsApp and were assisting with kit for a second-year running. “This is a voluntary initiative which we do to demonstrate our passion for the club. We also identify a player from the senior team we feel has impressed us during the season and give him something as our way of appreciating players that wear the black and white Amahlolanyama jersey,” said Ndlovu. He said the group is dedicated to serving the Bulawayo giants and is motivated by positive feedback they get from the club. “This is part of our small contributions we make which also drive us to commit to being active stakeholders. Right now Bosso Bulletin Group is in the process of sprucing up the club’s offices along Robert Mugabe and 4th Avenue,” Ndlovu said. The group also campaigns against hooliganism at football matches and seeks to play a vital role in Highlanders’ quest to return to their glory days. Ndlovu said it is important for supporters to rally behind the team on and off the field while the team is in the building process, as this will boost the boys’ confidence. @DecoDecent2
