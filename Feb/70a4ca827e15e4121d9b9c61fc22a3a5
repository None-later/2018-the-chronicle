 Nyaradzo Bakari,  Chronicle Reporter A 65-YEAR-OLD Bulawayo man has appeared in court for allegedly defrauding a woman of  $8 000 after he failed to deliver a car she had paid for. Gibson Khanye from North End suburb, allegedly masqueraded as a car dealer importing cars from the United Kingdom. He was allegedly paid $8 000 as deposit for a car which was selling for $12 000 by Ms Kelinah Ncube in August last year. Khanye was not asked to plead when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Franklin Mkhwananzi facing fraud charges last Friday. He was remanded out of custody to February 26. State allegations were that Khanye was given $8 000 through a bank transfer by Ms Ncube for a Mercedes Benz but failed to deliver within the agreed period of one month. “On August 23 2017 at about 11 AM and at main Post Office, the accused received into his account $8 000 as deposit for a car selling for $12 000. He had misrepresented to the complainant that he had a Mercedes Benz 10 tonne truck in the United Kingdom. He promised to import the car in a month’s time,” said the prosecutor, Mr Mclean Ndlovu. He said Khanye kept postponing the delivery date until Ms Ncube realised that she had been duped, the court heard. Mr Ndlovu said the money was not recovered. — @NyarieBakie
