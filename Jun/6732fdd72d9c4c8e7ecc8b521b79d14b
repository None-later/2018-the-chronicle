 Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Kamandama Memorial Fundraising Golf Tournament to be held today in Hwange will mark the beginning of the 46th commemorations of the Kamandama Mine disaster where 427 miners died after an explosion at Number Two Hwange Colliery on June 6, 1972. The golf tournament seeks to raise $20 000, whose proceeds will be channelled towards assisting widows and dependants of the victims and precedes the main commemoration to be held at the explosion site tomorrow. About 120 golfers are expected to converge at the Hwange Golf Course this morning to tee-off in the tournament. The event is expected to attract golfers from neighbouring countries such as South Africa, Zambia and Botswana, and will be played in a four-ball better ball scoring format, which consists of two teams of two players competing against each other. “We are finalising preparations for the commemorations and kick-start with the golf tournament on Tuesday, June 5, followed by the memorial. We have set this year’s (fundraising) target at $20 000,” said Rugare Dhobbie, Hwange Colliery Company corporate affairs manager. She said the funds would be raised through donations from Hwange Colliery Company business partners sponsoring a variety of goods that will be auctioned during the tournament. Ngoya Chamala and her veteran partner Robson Dumani won the 2017 edition of the Kamandama Memorial Golf tournament. Matron Mguni and her partner Marko Phiri were runners-up with 74 points, while the pair of Prisca Chimukoko and Thankyou Mwampamba scored 73 points to finish third. Hwange Golf Club captain Morgan Gorerino and Eddie Mazivadondo settled for fourth position with 71 points, with Moses Moyo and Prosper Manjengwa settling for fifth with 70 points. Viola Musengi won the longest drive in the ladies’ section, while Liberty Gumisa took the accolade in the men’s event. @ZililoR
