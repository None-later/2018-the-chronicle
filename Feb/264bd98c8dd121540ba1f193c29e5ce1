 Codelia Mondela, Court Reporter AN attendant at a Trek Petroleum filling station in Bulawayo allegedly stole about $43 000 worth of fuel and credited the debt to another company. Danisiwe Mtaka (33) from New Magwegwe suburb allegedly defrauded Trek Petroleum located along Fort Street of $42 979. Mtaka was not asked to plead to a charge of fraud when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Franklin Mkhwananzi. Mr Mkhwananzi granted him $300 bail on four conditions and remanded the matter to March 5 when he will be provided with a trial date. “Accused person is to reside at given address until the matter is finalised and to report to Bulawayo Central Police Station twice a week. Accused person is to surrender all travelling documents to the clerk of court and not to interfere with State witnesses,” he said. For the State, Mr Maclean Ndlovu said between October 1 last year and January 22 this year, Mtaka allegedly stole amounts of fuel for his personal use. “To cover up for his offence, he would then credit the drawings to Crown Africa Logistics a company which has a running account with Trek Petroleum,” he said. “The offence came to light last Thursday when Trek sent an itemised bill to Crown Africa Logistics who then queried some of the drawings which triggered internal investigations. It was during this exercise that Crown Africa discovered several prepaid customer receipts which were prepared by Mtaka credited to them.” The court heard that not all of the receipts had the number of Crown Africa as per the norm. A report was made to the police leading to Mtaka’s arrest. @MondelaC
