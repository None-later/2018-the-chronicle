Bulawayo Mayor Councillor Martin Moyo Andile Tshuma, Chronicle Reporter BULAWAYO City Council has commissioned 866 residential stands in Luveve 5 suburb with more expected to be availed later this year in different suburbs. The stands are the first to be fully serviced since 2006 as council had been incapacitated by resource constraints. Speaking during the ceremony last Friday, Bulawayo Mayor Councillor Martin Moyo said the commissioning of the council serviced stands was a big milestone in housing delivery. “The project has been a learning curve for council as these were internally serviced with the last internal servicing having been done by the local authority in 2004-2006. This Luveve 5 servicing is a pioneering project after so many years of inactivity in land servicing,” he said. Council also commissioned 29 service vehicles at the ceremony, which comprised 22 Nissan NP300 single cabs,  three Toyota quantum ambulances and road works truck and two UD mobile cranes and a Jet VAC. Clr Moyo said the economic challenges facing the country was delaying implementation of development projects in  the city. He said due to lack of resources, it was taking long to clear the city’s housing backlog which stands at 115 000. @andile_tshuma
