Nkosilathi Sibanda, Sports Reporter THE state of derelict of Plumtree town’s sports facilities has raised the concern of the local business community who have since pledged to assist council to revive the amenities. Plumtree town council has come under fire for seemingly neglecting its sports facilities that have turned into white elephants and at times used for non-sporting events. Following the outcry, the business community came out calling for council to enter into partnerships with the corporate world in order to develop social amenities in the border town. Dingumuzi Stadium, the town’s only major football and athletics facility, has on numerous occasions been condemned after failing to meet basic standards. The situation has led to the  town losing out on hosting national competitions. Following revelations on the dilapidated state of Dingumuzi and other facilities, the business community said they are willing to assist. Michael Sibanda, a retailer in the border town, said council must own up and start engaging other stakeholders. “Our concern is on the state of sports facilities. Why is council not renovating these facilities? It is incumbent upon them to do so. But a solution is there and its up to us to chip in. Plumtree town council has to find alternatives in that regard. We cannot let young talent go to waste,” said Sibanda who is also the proprietor of Golden Harmony Enterprises. Former Home Affairs deputy minister, Obedingwa Mguni, who is the Member of Parliament for Mangwe, underscored the need for council to pull up its socks.
