The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls
THIRTY-FOUR budding and experienced players took part in the Chess Association of Matabeleland North (CAMN) 2018 championship held at Dadani Secondary School in Victoria Falls at the weekend. The participants were drawn from five primary schools, Baobab, Chamabondo, St Josephine Bakhita that are all from Victoria Falls as well as Megawatt and Thomas Coulter from Hwange in the Under-9 and over category. There was also the open category whose participants were drawn from clubs in Dete, Hwange and Victoria Falls. Veteran Kripo Chivenge of CAMN retained the championship he won last year with 8.0 points, beating Aaron Mamvura (7.0 points) and Mqondisi Ndlovu (6.5 points) after nine games each in the open section. There were 10 participants in the open category, eight in the Under-9 and 16 for the over 9. In the Under-9s, Abneal Togara of Thomas Coulter emerged with 5.0 points from six games. He narrowly beat St Josephine Bakhitha’s Carol Ndlovu, who also scored 5.0 points, but fell through “bucholtz” (Bhlz), being the sum of opponents’ scores against a player in the event of a tally in points. After playing seven games each in the over 9 category, Craig Fazilahamed and Vonn Antonio both from Victoria Falls were champion and first runner-up with 6.5 points each. They were also separated on the Bhlz CAMN chief arbiter, Bongani Ngarivume said: “The turn-up was 100 percent and competition was tight in the open section where Mqondisi Ndlovu and Aaron Mamvura gave their best against champion Kripo Chivenge. There was also tight competition in the Under-9 and over 9 categories. The tournament was a success and displayed unity of purpose between CAMN and chess players, hence we look forward to a bigger and better tournament next year.” — @ncubeleon
