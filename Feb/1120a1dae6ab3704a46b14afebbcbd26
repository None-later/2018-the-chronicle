 Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE newly formed Rainbow Amateur Netball League formally submitted its constitution and request for adoption to the Zimbabwe Netball Association (Zina) as it moved a step up in taking over the running of the sport from the governing body. Set to be sponsored to the tune of $500 000 by Pickglow Trading (Pvt) Ltd, the netball league led by Melody Garikai hopes to be formally affiliated to Zina. “We have submitted our constitution to the Zina secretary general, Barbra Rice” said Moses Gukurume, the Rainbow Amateur Netball League spokesperson. When contacted, Rice could neither confirm nor deny receiving the documents. “I just told them to email their documents as I am attending a funeral now,” she said. According to the new league’s constitution, its objectives and mandate is to expand netball in all its forms to all parts of the country. It also aims to promote the creation of amateur provincial and lower levels of amateur netball leagues and administration structures. “It shall promote, co-ordinate, publicise and govern the playing of amateur netball leagues throughout the country. In particular, and without restricting the extent of the general principles stated above, the RNL shall translate and transmit all relevant information from Zina, and any other higher sports bodies to which RNL is affiliated for the benefit of individuals, clubs and districts, administer and govern amateur netball leagues, including the running of training courses and organisation of tournaments throughout Zimbabwe,” reads part of the constitution. @skhumoyo2000
