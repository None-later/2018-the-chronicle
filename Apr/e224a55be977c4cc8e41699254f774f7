Dr Obert Mpofu Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter ZANU-PF has called a special Politburo meeting tomorrow to discuss a number of issues among them vetting criteria for primary elections candidates. In an interview in Victoria Falls on Tuesday, Zanu-PF secretary for administration Dr Obert Mpofu said the party was geared for the primary elections set for May 5. “We have called for a special Politburo meeting to deal with the issue of primaries on Friday. All members are to attend and messages have been sent,” he said. The meeting will be held at the usual venue. Dr Mpofu, who was coming from Nemananga Ward in Hwange district where he attended the burial of his younger brother, Cde Collen Mpofu, who died a few days ago, said the party had a mandate to do the will of the people. “As you may have seen, this process is open to all members of the party who are desirous of representing the party in the harmonised elections. This is an opportunity to exercise what the people asked us to do when they went to the streets asking for a new dispensation under Operation Restore Legacy. “We feel this move by the party is all encompassing and is a recognition that Zanu-PF is a renewed progressive party which will look at supporters that subscribe to the new dispensation,” said Dr Mpofu. He said a number of issues bordering on primary elections and eligibility of members will be discussed. “The party will be looking at all those things in its consideration for those comrades who want to participate in the primary elections. We will also be looking at many other issues which will ensure we don’t entertain chancers and infiltrators and at the same time recognising that we are in the new dispensation,” said Dr Mpofu. Meanwhile, Dr Mpofu said the Commissariat department is working on a national restructuring exercise to ensure cell and branches are intact through the issuance of new computerised membership cards. The new card system is already in use. @ncubeleon
