Police confirmed the matter and said they were hunting for the suspect who had fled soon after learning that police were looking for him. Matabeleland South police spokesperson Inspector Philisani Ndebele said issuing death threats against anyone was a serious crime. “I can confirm we received a report of a man who is living in fear after having received death threats from a fellow villager. “The suspect approached him and told him that he wanted to kill him for testifying against him in court. “The suspect has fled and we are appealing to members of the public who may have any information on his whereabouts to come forward,” he said. Insp Ndebele said police would not hesitate to arrest anyone who threatens to kill anyone for whatever reasons. “Threatening to injure or end anyone’s life is a crime, whether implemented or not, it is a crime,” he said. @winnie_masara
