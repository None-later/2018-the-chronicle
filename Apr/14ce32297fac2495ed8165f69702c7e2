Lovemore Zigara in Gweru NINETEEN basketball coaches have completed a Level 1 Federation of International Basketball Association(Fiba) course held at Midlands Christian College in Gweru. The course was facilitated by Spanish international instructor, Manuel Cabello. Basketball Union of Zimbabwe (Buz) technical commission president Sikhumbuzo Ndlovu told Chronicle Sport the course was the first of its kind in Africa since Fiba changed its syllabus. “With these 19 coaches, we are sure that we have planted a very good seed for the development of basketball in the country. The course is the first course in Africa for the new Fiba syllabus, which was introduced last year. So we have had the privilege of becoming the first country in Africa to apply the newsyllabus,” said Ndlovu. Meanwhile, Buz is holding its Level 2 course at MCC with 15 participants. “We also have Buz Level 2 course, which started on Independence Day and will run until the end of the week. This is a high level coaching clinic that develops them as individuals and equips the country to be part of some of the best playing basketball nations. “We are hoping that from this crop and those who undertook the Fiba course we will have some good basketball products, which will translate to better results as a country. We are trying to map out a technical vision for the country, which can only be enhanced when we have a group of people that are singing the same song,” Ndlovu said. — @lavuzigara1
