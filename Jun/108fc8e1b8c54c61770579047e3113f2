 First Lady Auxilia Mnangagwa Nyaradzo Bakari, Chronicle Reporter THE number of women who have undergone cancer screening during the first quarter compared to last year has increased by about 500 percent, an increase attributed to the First Lady Cde’s involvement in the fight against cervical cancer. The Minister of Health and Child Care, Dr David Parirenyatwa, revealed this on Wednesday while announcing that the First Lady had been given a role as the Child and Maternal Heath ambassador. The Minister attributed the sharp increase in the number of women who have been screened to Cde Mnangagwa’s tireless efforts to conduct cancer awareness campaigns countrywide. Dr Parirenyatwa said 53 350 women were screened countrywide during this year’s first quarter compared to 9 469 during the same period last year. “The First Lady came to us at an opportune time. She expressed a willingness to support the cervical cancer screening programme. Through her outreach services, our screening programme literally shot through the roof,” he said. “A comparison of 1st quarter 2017 and 1st quarter 2018 has aptly demonstrated this. In 2017 1st quarter the MOHCC screened 9 469 women compared to 53 350 in 2018”. Cervical cancer is among the highest killer diseases in the country and reports show that it kills four women daily. The disease burden is worsened by the high HIV prevalence rate. According to the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Related Cancers in Zimbabwe report (ICO/WHO 2013), all women who are 15 years and above are at risk of developing cervical cancer. Risk factors include early age of sexual intercourse, multiple sexual partners, HIV infection, Sexually Transmitted Infections and smoking. Estimates indicate that every year 2 270 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 1 451 die from the disease. Lack of information and access to screening and treatment services has been a major contributor to the high mortality rate especially in rural areas. — @NyarieBakie
