 Walter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent A MAN from Masvingo allegedly hanged himself after squandering $1 500 meant to buy a car for his brother who is based in South Africa, police have confirmed. The body of Baison Mpofu (39) of Mucheke suburb was found hanging from a mango tree at a house in the same suburb. Acting Masvingo police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Kudakwashe Dehwa said the incident occurred on Monday at around 6AM. “I can confirm receiving a report of sudden death by hanging involving a man in Mucheke suburb. He had been given money to buy a car for his South African-based brother but decided to convert it to his own use,” said Asst Insp Dehwa. It is alleged that Mpofu’s unnamed brother had phoned him saying he was on his way to Zimbabwe and Mpofu had lied that he had bought the car. Police said Mpofu woke up at around 6AM under the guise that he wanted to relieve himself in the toilet which is outside the house but did not return. “Mpofu had allegedly told his nephew, Mr Cuthbert Mutandwa, that he wanted to commit suicide as he had misused $1 500 from his brother, meant to buy a car,” he said. A resident Mr Phillip Mugabe (36) stumbled on Mpofu’s body hanging from a tree at his yard near the toilet. A report was made to Chikato Police who attended the scene and took the body to Masvingo General Hospital mortuary for postmortem. @walterbmswazie2
