 Raymond Jaravaza, Sports Correspondent MAINLINE FC goalkeeper Kwanele Dodzi was the hero of the day when he denied Hwange three clear cut chances to ensure a share of the spoils in a Zifa Southern Region League match played at Dingumuzi Stadium in Plumtree on Saturday. Hwange were the favourites going into the match by virtue of being the log leaders but the Southern Region newcomers had other ideas. Dodzi pulled his first spectacular save of the day 10 minutes before the end of the first half when he stretched his right leg to block a shot from Shepherd Gadzikwa of Hwange. The Hwange technical bench was already up to celebrate the goal but the Mainline FC goalie’s split second reflex kept his team in the game. Hwange’s Courage Sibanda watched his close range flashing header tipped over the bar by Dodzi in the 51st minute. It took yet another well calculated dive by the hosts’ goal minder to deny Hwange’s Canaan Nkomo in the dying stages of the game. Hwange still lead the log standings with 18 points from nine games despite the draw. The coal miners’ coach Nation Dube said he was not happy with the manner the assistant referees handled the match. “If you were to count the number of times we were flagged for off side, you will understand why I’m not happy with the performance of the assistant referees. If this is how our away matches will be handled, then we have a big problem,” said Dube. Mainline coach Charlton Gumede said: “It’s always tough playing very experienced teams like Hwange but we did our best,” he said. @RaymondJaravaza
