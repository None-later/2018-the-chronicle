The Rainbow Amateur Netball League will host its inaugural end of year awards tonight where seven accolades will be presented. The awards, sponsored by Glow Petroleum, will be held at a Harare hotel, according to the league’s secretary-general Moses Gukurume. “Our awards will be bankrolled by our sponsor Glow Petroleum whom we are always indebted to for supporting development of the girl child. It’s our hope that it will be an evening to remember for the league and the winners,” said Gukurume. The league champions and two runners-up will be among those honoured tonight. There will also be prizes for the best defence where the likes of Thobekile Vundla of Khami Prison and Felistas Kwangwa could be in the running. Coach of the Year, Umpire of the Year and regional champions from the Matabeleland North, Southern Region, Central Region, Northen A and B as well as the Eastern Region will also be honoured. The Rainbow Amateur Netball League was formed this year following a $250 000 sponsorship package from Glow Petroleum. The major objective behind formation of the league was to bring professionalism to the game as well as to ensure that the girl child’s sweat is rewarded at the end of the day. Despite threats from the long serving Zimbabwe Netball Association leadership to ban any girls that participate in the league, there was a massive turn up of teams forcing the Sports and Recreation Commission to order the two parties to find common ground for the good of the game.
