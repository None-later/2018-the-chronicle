 Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter PARENTS have been urged to encourage their children to participate in sport as it explores and develops life skills. Acting Hwange Colliery Company managing director Shepherd Manamike told his company’s annual sports day that sport not only played an important role in exercise, but also promoted mental and psychological advances. “It is well known that children who participate in sports are less likely to drop out of school and become involved in drugs and alcohol activity while they excel in academic performances and sociability,” said Manamike. He said his company continues to offer and promote sports within the community to ensure the coordinated, strategic development of formal and informal facilities for sports, adding that the coal mining giant will continue to strive and foster active recreation that meets needs of a changing multicultural population by improving and providing attractive, sustainable, accessible, safe and quality facilities. “Hwange Colliery Company continues to host club and school tournaments at club, district, provincial and national level. Hwange last year managed to host arguably the best ever chapter of the Zimbabwe National Youth Games. Our sportsmen and women continue to dominate various leagues and tournaments in the country,” said Manamike. He lamented the relegation of Hwange FC from the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League, but hailed the team’s run in the Zifa Southern Region Division One League where they are leading the pack. Central Sports chairman Charles Zinyemba thanked Old Mutual for partnering with Hwange Colliery Company, saying this helped employees reduce stress, while maintaining a healthy lifestyle. “As Central Sports, we will continue on a positive trajectory path so that all our partners, Old Mutual Group included, realise full value for their investment,” said Zinyemba.
