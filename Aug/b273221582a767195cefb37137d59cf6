Twitter Response to “ED rules out inclusive Govt” Excellent. We don’t need opposition elements in the Government.  — @FanuelGurure. Response to “Malema ‘schools’ MDC-Alliance” I personally think Malema can actually school Chamisa because experience taught him political maturity. He is also a vibrant politician who has made a name for himself despite his failures. — @marvmara. Response to “Reports of military beatings, abductions false: SB Moyo” I think people are making these up to tarnish the image of the army. — @KuraiMuza. Website Response to “Biti, Komichi and 7 others wanted by ZRP” The law must be applied without fear or favour. In that way we can build the Zimbabwe we want, not one in which people banking on the support of their white masters in foreign lands can unashamedly proclaim violence. — Truthhurts. MDC-Alliance told all of us before elections that they would not accept any outcome that is not their victory and that people must invade the streets; that’s incitement in itself. Pre-determining results of an election is undermining democracy and voters. — George Banda. Response to “Grace sued over $278 000 debt” When you thought your control on life was untouchable. If she had known the future, she would have behaved better.  — Hombarume.
