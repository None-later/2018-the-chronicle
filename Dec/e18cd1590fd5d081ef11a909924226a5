AFTER songstress Nkwali and South Africa-based DJ Zwesta SA released a quality music video for their infectious house track Rafiki some weeks ago, it has debuted on Channel O. The music video that was shot in Germany and East London has been getting rave reviews with people commending its aesthetics. DJ Zwesta SA said he was delighted to have a song he produced being played on an international music video channel. “Never in my imagination did I expect the song to be playing on Channel O. I’m excited because just two weeks back, another song of mine We Rise was played there. “It’s the ultimate dream of every artiste to get that kind of recognition. This shows I’m doing something right,” he said. Doors seem to be opening for the DJ who has been getting requests from people for his services, just after Rafiki started showing on Channel O. “Just last Friday, I had two-radio interviews and the song has been getting a lot of radio airplay ever since then. I’m also getting event organisers and promoters offering to host launches for the track and its video,” DJ Zwesta SA said.
