 IT wasn’t the Test debut that Afghanistan wanted when they fell to an innings and 262-run defeat inside two days to top-ranked nation India on Friday. After India posted 474 in their first innings, Afghanistan had a torrid time with the bat as they were bowled out twice in one day. But they were not the first country to be dismissed twice in one day. There have been other teams as well. Here we look back at those matches with the first coming way back in 1952. India – 58 and 82 v England, Manchester, 1952 Bowled out twice: Third day The Indians know exactly what it feels like to be bowled out twice in a single day after becoming the first nation to do so more than fifty years ago. After England declared on 347-9, only two Indians reached double figures while three were out for a duck in their first innings total of 58. The tourists fared better next time but Alec Bedsar (5-27) and Tony Lock (4-36) ripped up the batting order as India scored 82 and fell to an innings and 207 runs defeat in three days. Zimbabwe – 59 and 99 v New Zealand, Harare, 2005 Bowled out twice: Second day The game never saw another moment like India’s collapse until 53 years later when Zimbabwe added to the list. New Zealand amassed 452-9 with Brendon McCullum and Daniel Vettori both scoring centuries. The latter later returned with the ball to take two scalps as only two Zimbabwe batsmen reached double digits in a dismal 59-run total. It got even worse for the hosts as Vettori added to his tally with a four-wicket haul in the second innings. Zimbabwe went on to score 99 with Hamilton Masakadza scoring 42 of those runs in the innings and 294 run loss. Zimbabwe – 51 and 143 v New Zealand, Napier, 2012 Bowled out twice: Second day Same teams and same result as New Zealand repeated the feat seven years on – this time on home soil. With the Kiwis scoring 495-7d, only Malcom Waller reached double figures with a top-score of 23 in their total of 51 as Trent Boult, Tim Southee, Doug Bracewell and Chris Martin took two wickets each. The tourists fared a little better with Regis Chakabva hitting 63 but that was as good as it got as Martin added another six scalps to his tally to complete an innings and 103-run win inside two days. — Sport360.com
