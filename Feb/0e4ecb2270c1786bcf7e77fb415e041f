Lovemore Zigara in Gweru MIDLANDS-based Premiership sides Chapungu and Shabanie Mine have expressed confidence that their home grounds Ascot and Maglas stadia will be ready for use ahead of the 2018 PSL season. Newly promoted side Nichrut will also use Ascot Stadium for their home matches. The two facilities were condemned by the Zifa First Instance Board (FIB), which went on a nationwide tour inspecting the clubs’ adherence to the Fifa Club Licensing system. Should the two facilities be condemned during the second inspection in a fortnight’s time, the clubs will be forced to look for alternative home grounds, which could turn out to be Mandava due to its proximity. Chapungu secretary Mkhululi Dube said the club together with Gweru City Council are working on the things raised by FIB to ensure Ascot is ready by the time action begins. “We are happy that as a club we met most of the requirements of the Fifa Club Licensing system, but we fell short on the stadium, as it is not up to standard. The FIB raised concerns with the toilets in the VVIP area as well as the seating in that area and the dressing rooms,” said Dube. “As we speak, the club and council are seized with the matter and work is underway to ensure that the stadium is ready by the time the season begins in March.” Shabanie Mine public relations officer Weston Wesley said the club had taken the matter to the owners of Maglas, Shabanie Mashava Mines, who have promised to look into the issue. The 2018 PSL season is set to kick-off on March 10. @lavuzigara1
