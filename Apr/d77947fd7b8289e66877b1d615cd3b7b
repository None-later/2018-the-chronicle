 Pamela Shumba, Senior Reporter THE Government is making frantic efforts to raise funds to renovate the Plumtree High School hostel that was destroyed by fire on Tuesday last week, the Acting Minister of Information, Media and Broadcasting Services, Cde Simon Khaya Moyo, said yesterday. In a statement, Minister Khaya Moyo, who is also the Minister of Energy and Power Development and Bulilima/Mangwe Senator, said the inferno that destroyed the school’s monumental double storey Lloyd House was an unfortunate incident that needed to be attended to immediately. “On my return over the weekend from the People’s Republic of China where I had gone as part of his Excellency President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s delegation, I was shocked to learn of the Plumtree High School inferno where property worth thousands of dollars went up in smoke as fire destroyed a double storey hostel,” he said. “I understand that the fire department in Plumtree is still investigating the cause of the fire and cost of the damage. This is obviously a disaster of unimaginable proportions and ghastly to contemplate. Members of staff, students, parents and the community in Plumtree are traumatised by the sad incident.” Minister Khaya Moyo said efforts were being made to resuscitate the hostel that houses about 120 Advanced Level pupils.  “As Senator of the area and a minister in Government, I’m making every effort to consult relevant authorities and well-wishers to address the challenge as soon as possible. We can’t wait a day longer. “I’ll also be visiting the school during the course of the week. We must overcome,” he said. Last Friday, Government dispatched a team of evaluators to assess and quantify the damage caused by the inferno. — @pamelashumba1
