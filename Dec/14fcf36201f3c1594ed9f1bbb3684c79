AFRO deep/tribal house trio Djembe Monks will today launch their album Bantu Migrant as well their craft beer at the National Art Gallery of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo. Bantu Migrant is Djembe Monks’ third studio project. It has 13 tracks with collaborations from Willis Wataffi Afrika, Mimmi Tarukwana, Hudson Simbarashe, Trust Samende (Mokoomba), Ex-Mile, Mzoe7 and Martyn Oosthuizen. In partnership with The River Brewing Co, the trio is also set to launch their own craft beer which they have named “The Djembe Monks’ Brew’ today.
The beer that will be available on tap is being brewed in Victoria Falls by The River Brewing Co, the biggest micro-brewery in the resort town. Explaining their partnership with the brewery company, Djembe Monks said: “The River Brewing Co always hosts us in Victoria Falls. Having been there and experienced a rare taste of pure ale inspired us to try something new. “They were impressed with the energy we bring to the Brewery and so the idea of making a specially crafted brew inspired by our ethnic organic sounds came about.” After the launch, the craft beer will be available on tap at The Smokehouse in Bulawayo. The group said they will be performing around the country this festive season promoting their latest project. “We shall be performing in Bulawayo, Plumtree and Victoria Falls till the end of the year. The plan is to promote Bantu Migrant, perform and be on holiday at the same time. “There’s no point in doing all this if it’s not fun.” Djembe Monks have been working hard this year as they performed in Botswana at the Maun International Arts Festival, Tribe initiation in Gaborone as well as at Unplugged in Harare. They were also an opening act at Mokoomba’s show in Bulawayo. — @Sxoop_Kyu
