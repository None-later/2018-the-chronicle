Raisdon Baya Showbiz Correspondent VETERAN playwright Raisedon Baya has penned a play titled, Fragile, that tackles topical issues such as rape, abortion and xenophobia. Debuting on March 22 and 23 at the Bulawayo Theatre, the play that is being facilitated by Centre for Talent Development (CTD) who popularised Live Literature Project in schools, will first be showcased to schoolchildren in the afternoon at the same venue. The cast, which is hard at work rehearsing, comprises Musawenkosi Sibanda, Sthabile Ndubiwa, Elton Sibanda, Clinton Ndlovu, Stanley Mapfumo, Charmaine Mudau, Agnes Ncube, Anita Moyo, Lonesome Kudzai and Chipo Mawarire. Fragile follows the story of the Patapata twins, who are separated when one of them, Sweetness, runs away from home and lands in South Africa after being raped by their father. Upon arrival in South Africa, Sweetness discovers that that country is in flames as xenophobia is at its peak. According to Baya, Fragile is an experimental piece that uses physical theatre, music, storytelling and dialogue to tell a story most writers would usually shy away from. “As the title suggests, sensitive issues are discussed in this play. Nothing is taboo. Abortion, sex, homophobia and xenophobia — everything is thrown into a boiling pot, cooked at high temperature and then served with flair by this talented and energetic cast,” said Baya. After watching one of the rehearsals, veteran actor and theatre trainer Memory Kumbota said he was impressed by what he saw. “The play promises to be a pulsating sensual dance around our own sensibilities. That is not theatre. That is an experience,” said Kumbota. “This is a must watch play as it defies the odds. The script carries powerful subtext, necessary darkness that the world has been shunning for years without specific reason.”
