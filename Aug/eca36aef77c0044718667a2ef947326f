ASAPH Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent Still riding high from his monster hit, Mambo, fast-rising rapper Asaph says he feels the pressure of performing on a big stage as he takes his act to Unplugged Zimbabwe in Harare tomorrow. He will share the stage with multi award winning South Africa’s Shekhinah who headlines the show. Mambo has hogged the top spot of the ZiFM Stereo GTel top 40’s weekly chart for a month. He will be the first rapper from Bulawayo to perform at Unplugged Zimbabwe in Harare and Asaph said this will be a litmus test for him. “It feels like a serious audition because even amongst the local artists I’m the only Hip Hop act on the line up. Performing in front of a new crowd, it’s exciting,” said Asaph, real name Tafadzwa Tarukwana. The award winning artiste, said doing well under the pressure of impressing could open more doors for him in the future. “I’m feeling pressure because it’s a big moment for me. Doing well on that stage will open a lot of doors and expose a large chunk of Harare show goers to Asaph and what I’m about,” said Asaph. He said he hopes to replicate the hype Mambo has on radio with his performance on stage. “Also with the way Mambo has been played on ZiFM Stereo I’m sure there are a few people coming to see if I’m as good on stage as I am on record. The stakes are high but it’s nothing new. My whole career I’ve been proving myself so I’m going to have a great time with the team I’m taking,” said Asaph. On stage also will be Tamy Moyo, Buhle, Magitare Live, Those Guys Vacho alongside DJs Trill Angel, Reverb 7 and TK Beats.
