Showbiz Correspondent THOSE who love to bake confectionary products from home will be showcasing how good they are during the two-day Bakers’ Expo that begins this Friday. Proceeds from the event being held at the ZITF Pavilion will go to charity. On the first day, there will be a Mr and Miss Bakers’ Expo pageant hosted by SuQea and entrance is pegged at $2. On the following day, those highly skilled in the culinary arts will be showcasing their various finished confectionary products. One of the organisers, Joice Fred said the Bakers’ Expo was a platform for entrepreneurs to showcase their talent. “There are many people who have been baking at home and they are very good at it. This expo is being held to promote them so that they hopefully, get business,” said Fred. To participate, Fred said stalls were going for $30 while those who want to witness festivities will have to pay $2. She said the Mr and Miss Bakers’ Expo pageant was the brainchild of her daughter Princess. Proceeds from the pageant will be donated to King George IV, a place dear to Princess as she attended school there. Next year when the event is held again, the organisers will identify another charity organisation to donate proceeds to.
