Soya beans Business Reporter GOVERNMENT has called on soya bean farmers to hold on to their crop to allow for the announcement of a new producer price in the next three weeks. In a statement yesterday, the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement, said the new price would be much higher than the current Grain Marketing Board (GMB) price of $610 per tonne. “Government has noticed that the soya bean crop is now being harvested and farmers are already selling the crop sometimes at relatively low prices in the informal sector. “Government would like to inform the farmers that it is currently finalising a soya bean producer price for farmers, which will be much higher than the current (GMB) soya bean buying price of $610 per tonne,” said the ministry. The new producer price is set to be announced within the next three weeks. “Farmers are therefore, requested to be patient and wait for this exercise to be finalised. Government wants the price increase to directly benefit the farmers. “Right now it’s possible that the people buying the soya beans will later on sell to GMB for a higher and better price. Farmers are encouraged to act wisely,” said the ministry.
