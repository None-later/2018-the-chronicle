 Takudzwa Chitsiga, Harare Bureau THE National Division One Soccer Leagues which were set to resume this weekend with several matches lined up across the country have been postponed forthwith. All the four Division One Leagues had taken a sabbatical to pave way for the harmonised elections held on Monday and wanted the games to go ahead but have since shelved the idea. The games will only be held next weekend with Runyararo Service Stations Northern region Division One administrator Vivian Tshuma confirming the developments. “We have decided like any other leagues like the Premier Soccer League shelved all the games which were scheduled for this weekend. “We are taking a short break as there are some programmes which are underway throughout the country,” he said. The delay in the resumption of the second leg encounters are not worrying the leagues with Runyararo Service Stations Northern Region Division One chairman Willard Manyengavana saying they are on the right path and all the fixtures are supposed to be fullfiled within the stipulated period. “We are still in the right track and I am convinced that we will manage to end the season at the right time. We are grateful that the teams managed to fulfill all their fixtures in the first round. “We had a good first round and I believe we will also notice the same in the second leg where there will be few incidences of violence. We managed not to have matches abandoned which is very good. “There is now good rapport between teams after we had a team building exercise with club representatives and I am very happy. “We are definitely going to end the league in November,” said Manyengavana. There is concern that the league which has managed to lure partners may find another sponsor who will come on board with a knockout tournament.
