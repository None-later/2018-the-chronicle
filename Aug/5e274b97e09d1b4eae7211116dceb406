Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter FINANCIAL constraints have forced Team Zimbabwe to drop some sporting disciplines ahead of their Confederation of School Sport Associations of Southern Africa (Cossasa) ball games trip to Namibia next week. The games will be held in Namibia from August 23 to 26. Zimbabwe are sending two age-groups, the Under-13s who are under the auspices of the National Association of Primary Schools Heads (Naph) and the Under-17s who are administered by the National Association for Secondary Heads (Nash). Arthur Maphosa, acting Nash president who was elevated to the position last week, taking over from Johnson Madhuku who stepped down after winning the Bikita East Parliamentary seat, said Team Zimbabwe’s Cossasa team goes into camp this morning in Bulawayo. Maphosa will be the acting Nash president until the organisation’s next elections set for June 2019. “It’s an honour that my fellow council members have confidence in me to steer the ship and uplift Nash to new heights. Right now I’m seized with the preparations for the Cossasa ball games to be held in Namibia next week. The teams are starting their camp in Bulawayo on Wednesday (today), with the Nash squad camping in Eveline while Naph will be housed at Northlea. We will be leaving for Namibia on August 20. “Sadly, we’ve had to scale down on teams to take along because of financial challenges. We’ve left some teams and in doing so, we looked on the past performances and that is why we are taking along teams that have won us medals at these ball games,” said Maphosa. Nash are taking the girls’ and boys’ basketball, tennis and volleyball teams. They are also travelling with the netball team to Namibia. Maphosa said the girls’ and boys’ soccer teams will seek solace in a COPA Coca-Cola trip to Kenya. Meanwhile, Naph teams travelling to Namibia are netball, tennis (boys and girls), boys’ rugby 7s and girls’ and boys’ volleyball. @ZililoR
