 Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe girlsâ€™ hockey team yesterday rose to the occasion by beating Ghana 2-1 in a bronze medal match at the African Youth Games in Algeria to qualify for the Youth Olympic Games pencilled for Argentina in October. The girls were beaten 2-0 by South Africa in the semi-finals on Wednesday, but they summoned all the courage in this crucial game to hoist the national flag high by qualifying for the prestigious Youth Olympic Games. The courageous girls coached by Tendai Maredza began their journey in Algeria with a 0-4 loss to Ghana, then drew 3-3 against South Africa in their second match. They registered another 3-3 stalemate against Namibia before turning on the power to dismiss Nigeria 4-0 followed by an emphatic 10-0 demolition of host nation Algeria to set up a semi-final duel against South Africa. With the Youth Olympic Games three months away, the squad now has to fully prepare for tougher matches in Argentina than they encountered in Algeria. The girls now join the Zimbabwe Equestrian team, Kenneth Raynorand Lorryn Bass (single scull) and Christie-Rose Prestorias (judo) in qualifying for the Youth Olympic Games.
