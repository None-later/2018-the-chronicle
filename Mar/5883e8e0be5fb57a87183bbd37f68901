A tree fell over the house last Sunday, following heavy rains that were accompanied by strong winds. The owner, Mrs Leliah Muvunzi (73), said the family was forced to use the living room as a bedroom for all members. She said the incident, which occurred at around at 2PM, resulted in some property being damaged. “It was by the grace of God that we survived such a disaster. The situation is bad, heavy winds uprooted the tree and it fell onto the house, destroying the roof to our bedrooms. I had left my grandchildren alone as I was attending a funeral next door but they were lucky to survive. We are stranded as we all have to sleep in the living room,” said Mrs Muvunzi. “I am a widow and my daughters are not able to help as they are unemployed. The only one who is employed can’t afford to cover all expenses. So I am appealing to well-wishers to assist in putting a roof on our house. I am worried that the rains will continue and this would mean more damage to our property.” She said those who are willing to help can contact her on 0773963611. The heavy rains, which started about two weeks ago, left scores of residents stranded due to flash floods with Nketa, Nkulumane, Tshabalala and Cowdray Park suburbs being the most affected. — @NyarieBakie
