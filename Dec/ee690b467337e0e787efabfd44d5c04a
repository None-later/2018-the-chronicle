CITY of Kings’ top 10 chess players will today clash in a two-day competition dubbed “Bulawayo Championships” to be held at the National University of Science and Technology (Nust). Nkulumane’s Tapiwa Jele will defend his title against nine other players who amassed most points at the Bulawayo Chess Association’s (BCA) organised tournaments between January and November this year. Hoping to dethrone Jele is Castro Sibanda of Nust Chess Club, winner of the BCA Easter Open as well as the BCA Independence Open tournaments.

The winner of the tournament will get $80, with the runner-up taking home $50 while the third best player will pocket $20,” said Moses Mutipforo, BCA spokesperson.
