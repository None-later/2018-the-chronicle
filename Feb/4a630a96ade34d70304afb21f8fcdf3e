Councillor Charles Chikozho Sukoluhle Ndlovu, Business Correspondent GOVERNMENT has approved Gweru City Council’s 2018 standstill budget of $38 million and has asked council to strive to attain a 30:70 salary and service delivery budget ratio requirement. Government wants councils to spend the bulk of their revenue on service delivery as opposed to salaries and allowances as is the case now at most councils. In an interview yesterday, Gweru Mayor Councillor Charles Chikozho confirmed that Government had approved his council’s budget. “I’m pleased to announce that the Government has approved our 2018 budget which is pegged at $38 million. It is now up to the council to provide a road map on how it intends to use the money,” he said. Clr Chikozho said the local authority was asked to work towards attaining the 30:70 salary and service delivery budget ratio requirement. “The Government said we must prioritise our number one mandate which is that of service delivery. We should ensure that our salary costs take 30 percent of revenue inflows while 70 percent goes towards service delivery,” he said. Clr Chikozho said in order to attain this, council expenditure will be strictly managed while measures will be put in place to enhance revenue collection as well as expand the revenue base. He said since residents will not experience any increase on rates and other service charges, council expects them to pay their bills regularly to avoid incurring arrears. “Due to the harsh economic environment, we will not effect any tariff increases this year and this calls for council to be more innovative in delivering service at low cost without compromising quality,” said Clr Chikozho.
