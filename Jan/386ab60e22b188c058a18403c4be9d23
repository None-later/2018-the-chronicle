Paul Mudede Codelia Mondela, Court Reporter A MARRIED Salvation Army pastor from Bulawayo who admitted in court that he was in an adulterous relationship, has been acquitted of rape. Paul Mudede (41) who denied the rape charges but said he was in a relationship with Audrey Madyanenzara (19), a congregant, was found not guilty by Mrs Sibongile Msipa-Marondedze and acquitted. A court heard that Madyanenzara sent Mudede her nude pictures and made sexual advances at the pastor. Mrs Msipa-Marondedze said the State had failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. She said: “After going through the evidence given by the complainant, the court is satisfied that she is a liar. She has admitted that she gave false information to the police officers who recorded her statement so how is the court expected to believe her?’ Madyanenzara could not hold back her tears after the verdict and she rushed out of the courtroom wailing loudly. During the trial, Madyanenzara told the court that Mudede raped her twice in 2016. She said she fell pregnant after the first rape which occurred in October and Mudede gave her money to buy tablets to terminate the pregnancy. Madyanenzara however said she could not remember the date when she was raped for the second time. “He gave me $30 and I bought tablets from the pharmacy. I kept the matter a secret as I was preparing to be a pastor,” she said. Mudede was represented by Tanaka Muganyi of Tanaka Law Chambers while Mr Robin Mukura appeared for the state.—@Mondela.
