Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent THE formula is simple, post a picture on Facebook with the sexiest smile then Chivi Rural District Council chairman Killer Zivhu will give you a cool $500 if he’s impressed. And these dollars are not bond notes but they are five crispy $100 bills called Benjamins in street lingo. A jovial Zivhu posted a picture calling on people to share snaps of themselves smiling on his timeline and the one with the most likes would win the $500. Zivhu seems to be taking a leaf from flamboyant businessman Genius “Ginimbi” Kadungure, who gave away a brand new iPhone8 during this week for the person who best imitated him during the My guy challenge. According to posts by Zivhu, the competition started on Wednesday when Zivhu posted: “Show your sexy smile haisi mhosva kana kusakwana don’t comment usina kuisa yako.” Then on Thursday he shared picture of him holding the cash assuring people that it was not a gimmick. “The $500 for a sexy smile competition is real.” Meanwhile, in South Africa, social media has been in stitches after a woman was filmed coining her own term to mean recording a video went viral. The woman dressed in a pink dress was being supposedly filmed by her boyfriend somewhere in South Africa and she said: “Why ungiDVDya.” The unidentified woman was trying to say why you are recording a video of me. She said the word DVD, which is loosely used to refer to a digital disc to store videos such as movies among other things. Or she was referring to a DVD player which is used to play movies on DVD disc. Whatever she meant, the term has gone viral. It has since appeared on thousands of statuses on social media and is the latest slang used by those who want to sound chic. It’s a perfect example of serendipity that continuously causes language to evolve the world over.
