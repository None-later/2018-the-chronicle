Brian Vitori ZIMBABWE’S left-arm fast bowler Brian Vitori has been cleared to bowl in international cricket after his bowling action was found to be legal following remedial work and reassessment, the International Cricket Council announced on Saturday. As Vitori passed an independent reassessment of his bowling action after serving a 12-month suspension, if he is reported again, it will be deemed as his first offence. Vitori was originally suspended from bowling in January 2016, but he was reassessed and permitted to resume bowling in June 2016. He was again reported during the Bulawayo one-day international against Sri Lanka in November 2016 and was subsequently suspended for 12 months in December 2016 after his action, for some deliveries were found illegal for the second time in a space of two years. Earlier this month on January 8, Vitori underwent a reassessment of his bowling action at the High Performance Centre in Pretoria and it was found that his elbow extension was within the 15-degree level of tolerance permitted under the ICC Illegal Bowling Regulations. In case, the umpires find that Vitori is still bowling with a suspect action, they are at liberty to report again. To assist the umpires, the ICC will provide them with images and video footage of the bowler’s significantly remodelled legal bowling action. Vitori, who will be turning 28 next month, made his international debut in August 2011 and has taken 29 wickets in 20 ODIs so far, including two five-wicket hauls. He also featured in four Tests and 11 Twenty20 Internationals. — Wisden India
