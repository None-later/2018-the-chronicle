Darlington Dodo Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO City FC officially unveiled its technical team for the 2018 season at the weekend with Darlington Dodo named as head coach. The City executive unveiled its men at a two-day strategic planning workshop held to underline the season’s objectives as well as how to grow the club’s brand. The municipal-owned side also opted to re-assign last season’s technical department that was led by Mandla Mpofu, who has since joined Highlanders following what the executive considered a poor performance last year. City survived relegation on the last day of the season. “Firstly l would like to thank the executive for calling me for the interviews and giving me the job. I must say l was impressed by the talks l had with them. I realised this was the right institution to join. We have started working, we are aiming to build a very good team that will compete and be recognised. I have seen the previous team and we are confident we will build a formidable team,” said Dodo. “A number of players came for trials and we are still accessing them. l am not at liberty to divulge any names at the moment, but l can tell you that we have engaged Lucky Nyathi and Tatenda Tavengwa both from Tsholotsho,” he said. Asked on the possibility of adding Simon Munawa, Erick Mudzingwa and James Kaonda, the gaffer said it would be a plus to add such experience to his team. The technical team comprises physical trainer Try Ncube, goalkeepers’ coach Julius Ndlovu, Under-20 (Johannes Ngodzo), Under-18 (Ali “Baba” Dube), Under-16 (Innocent Mapuranga) and Under-14 (Bruce Tshuma). City chief executive officer Mackenzie Moyo said: “We are still working on the assistant coach. We are very happy with the technical team that we have engaged. We are also happy that the whole technical team from the juniors to the senior team are working together to try and build the team. It is encouraging to work together to mould the team.” @innocentskizoe
