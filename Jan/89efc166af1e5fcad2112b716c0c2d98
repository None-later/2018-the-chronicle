 Real Madrid crashed to a humiliating Copa del Rey exit on Wednesday when they were knocked out by little Leganes in the quarter-finals, adding to the atmosphere of crisis at the European champions. Real lost 2-1 in the second leg at the Bernabeu as the tie finished 2-2 on aggregate with their modest city neighbours going through on away goals despite having lost the first leg 1-0 last week. Javi Eraso gave Leganes a 32nd minute lead before Karim Benzema levelled after 47 minutes but Brazilian striker Gabriel Pires then hit the winner with a firm header eight minutes later. It was a depressing evening for Zinedine Zidane’s side who, despite being in the Champions’ League last 16 where they face Paris Saint-Germain in three weeks’ time, are 19 points behind Barcelona in the Spanish title race. The home fans let their feelings known by booing off the team at half-time. Leganes have the lowest budget in La Liga of just €45 million – six times less than the €675 million commanded by mighty Real. Even without Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale, who were rested Wednesday after starring in the 7-1 rout of Deportivo La Coruna at the weekend, Real’s second-string side should still have had enough firepower for a side languishing in 13th spot in La Liga. But Leganes put on an inspired display, despite having their backs to the wall late in the game, to make the semi-finals for the first time. — Sport24.
