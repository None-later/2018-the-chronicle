Darlington Dodo Noel Munzabwa in Manzini, Eswatini MANZINI Sundowns’ appetite for Zimbabwean coaches seems insatiable after they hired Darlington Dodo as their new coach. The Eswatini MTN Premier League outfit announced on Monday that the former Bulawayo City coach had replaced Zenzele Ace Dlamini. Dodo reportedly penned a two-year performance-based contract with the Ikapa Boys, who last lifted silverware six and a half years ago when they won the Swazi Telecom Charity Cup under another Zimbabwean Rodwell Dhlakama. Dhlakama, who is now at Chapungu United, led Sundwons to a 2-1 win over Manzini Wanderers in the final in 2011 and to a runners-up finish in the MTN Premiership. Dhlakama led Sundowns to a successful defence of the charity cup with a 1-0 win over Young Buffaloes in 2012, but his stay was cut short following disagreements over the prize money sharing. In 2016, Sundowns successfully lured Godfrey Tamirepi, who, however, lasted 10 league games due to disagreements over progress and youth development integration. According to a local daily, Sundowns’ chairman Mark Carmichael confirmed the appointment of Dodo, who arrived in the country last Thursday. “He is the right candidate for the job because he is knowledgeable, qualified and experienced. It is an ‘open contract’, but football contracts by their nature are performance-based,” Carmichael told the local media. Dodo (47) is a Caf A Licence holder and won the 2009 Premier Soccer League title with Gunners FC. He coached Botswana giants Township Rollers from 2012-13. — @NoelMunzabwa.
