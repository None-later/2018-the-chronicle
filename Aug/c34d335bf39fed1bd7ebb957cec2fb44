This year’s edition will be held from September 26 to 29 under the theme ‘Realities and Experiences’. The exhibition will open on September 28 at the National Gallery in Bulawayo. Curator of the exhibition Mthabisi Phiri said: “This exhibition should be a space for people to tell those stories. “The exhibition asks artists to treat the events, experiences and realities of Zimbabwe as matter and material. We need to tell these stories.” He said the reason the exhibition was being held was to put to art Zimbabwe’s realities and experiences from social, political, economic and religious spheres. “These events have been exciting and painful and these experiences have been our realities. “These realities cannot be separated  from our past and we should not fail to see the participation from                                                                              individuals, communities to organisations,” he said. Phiri said the deadline for submissions for the exhibition is September 18. “The artist is expected to submit artworks in line and or relevant to the theme. Artworks must be in two dimensions  and three dimension, and need to be  properly framed and ready for hanging or exhibition. “Artistes should produce new work and or submit relevant work for this exhibition. The artist is responsible for the delivery of the work before the exhibition submission deadline and after the exhibition duration,” said Phiri.
