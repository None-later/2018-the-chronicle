Qiniso Bruce Sivako Esinathy Sibanda, Chronicle Reporter LOCAL actor Qiniso Bruce Sivako well known for his lead role in the ZBCtv drama Yeyeni Bantu! has ventured into politics. Sivako’s arts career mushroomed in the late 80s when he acted in local dramas including Free Man, a local movie based on Tsitsi Dangarembwa’s book and was also a presenter on a kids programme, Kids. The 45-year-old from Pumula East, is contesting a councillorship seat to represent Pumula East, Old Pumula  and Robert Sinyoka under the Zimbabwe Democratic Union party ticket. Attracted by the political world, Sivako said he decided to serve his community as he believes he is the right candidate for the post. “I was born and grew up in Pumula so I understand the needs of the people here. There are many outstanding issues that former councillors failed to address,” said Sivako. He said he will use his personal experiences as a stakeholder in an organisation that deals with transforming lives of the disadvantaged children in the community to assist the youths. “Money is everywhere but some people do not know where and how to get it. I have the capacity to teach youths the means of making money,’ said Sivako.
