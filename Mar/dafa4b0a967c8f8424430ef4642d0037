 Prince Sunduzani, Business Reporter ZIMBABWE’s EcoCash users can now receive money from Orange money users in Botswana after the two operators signed a partnership to harmonise mobile money services. Econet announced the partnership in a statement, saying the move will improve the ease of remitting money from Botswana. The facility is one way, as EcoCash users cannot send money to their Orange money counterparts. “Receive money from Botswana with EcoCash and Orange Money instantly. All you need to do is tell your loved ones in Botswana to send you money through Orange money and your wallet,” said Econet, the parent company for EcoCash. The giant telecoms firm has struck other similar partnerships with regional and international players to facilitate diaspora remittances into the country. Zimbabwe received about $1 billion in diaspora remittances last year. Apart from sending and receiving money, the EcoCash platform also allows users to make purchases, settle debts among many other monetary transactions. @PrinceNkosy102
