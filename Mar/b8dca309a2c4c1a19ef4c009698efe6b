 Mukudzei Chingwere, Harare Bureau ZIMBABWE has started reaping rewards for hosting the ICC Cricket World Cup qualifier with budding cricketers set to acquire expert advice and coaching from international players during their stay here. Through the ICC Cricket for Good project, the host nation’s young players will get a lifetime opportunity to interact and get expert advice from international stars. Zimbabwe will host the qualifiers from March 4-25, with venues spread from Harare, Kwekwe and Bulawayo. Yesterday, in Kwekwe, 80 players under the age of 13 were trained by Zimbabwe’s development coaches at Kwekwe Sports Club and got a chance to interact with the Nepal national team players. More budding cricketers have been invited to come and get expert advice from international players on March 13 and 17. Midlands province Sports Commission boss, Simon Masaka, said the project will help the development of budding cricketers. “The project helps the development of cricket from grassroots and getting a chance to mingle with international stars motivates them. “Today we had about 80 players from seven schools who came and got training from Zimbabwe’s development coaches and they also interacted with Nepal players after their training. “When we get to the knockout phase of the competition players whose teams who will not be participating will also train these youngsters. “For Kwekwe Sports Club, we have set tentative dates of 13 and 17 March in conjunction with ICC, but for the 17th there might be a change since we have a game here on that day. “The same project will also be done in Harare and Bulawayo but I am not sure about their dates. “The project will help children fight things like stage fright when they become professionals and they will also have something to remember after the tournament,” said Masaka.
