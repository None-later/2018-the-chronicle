 Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter NRZ Leopards of Dete in Matabeleland North have been roped into the Southern Region Division One League as a replacement for Lunda FC of Binga who failed to affiliate. NRZ Leopards becomes the 15th side to affiliate before today’s deadline. Augustine Ndlovu, the Zifa Southern Region administrator, confirmed NRZ Leopards’ promotion and said three other clubs, ZRP Bulawayo, Black Boots and Chiwororo, had up to the end of today to pay their affiliation fees. “It was agreed at the annual general meeting that the clubs have to pay their affiliation fees and show commitment by Wednesday 14 March. We have 15 clubs that have registered and we are waiting for ZRP Bulawayo, Black Boots and Chiwororo to confirm their status by deadline day. We have also roped in NRZ Leopards of Dete, who become the second side from Matabeleland North to be promoted. Otherwise we are good to go,” said Ndlovu. NRZ Leopards join newly promoted sides, Bulawayo’s Division 2 champions Toronto FC of Pumula, runners-up CIWU, Plumtree-based Mainline FC and Moto Moto from Hwange. The new teams’ affiliation fees are $2 500, while old clubs, including those coming from the PSL, pay $2 000. Other teams that have been confirmed for the 2018 season are Hwange and Tsholotsho FC, who were relegated from the Premiership, perennial campaigners ZPC Hwange, Makomo, who hired veteran coach Rahman Gumbo, Mosi Rovers, the only team from Victoria Falls, ambitious Talen Vision, Indlovu Iyanyathela, Zim Leopards and Casmyn.
