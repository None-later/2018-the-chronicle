 Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent THE Zimbabwe Electoral Commission’s (Zec) Biometric Voter Registration (BVR) mop up exercise has ended with more than 5, 3 million people having registered to vote. The mop up exercise which started on January 10 ended last Thursday and 5 310 734 people had registered. The commission had targeted to register 5,5 million during the exercise. Zec’s Commissioner Dr Qhubani Moyo said the electoral commission is satisfied with the number of people that have so far registered. Dr Moyo encouraged members of the public who missed out on the mobile registration exercise to visit the commission’s district centres to register. “The number that we got is an excellent number because it represents an overwhelming turnout by the citizens. Voter registration is still on at the static centres and those yet to register can visit the centres,” said Dr Moyo. He said Zec has now turned its focus on an exercise to clear multiple registration. — @nqotshili
