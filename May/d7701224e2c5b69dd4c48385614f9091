Rodwell Dhlakama Lovemore Zigara in Gweru CHAPUNGU have recalled Rodwell Dhlakama as technical manager from Blue Swallows to assist the Gweru based premiership outfit following an indifferent start to the season. Tendai Chikuni remains head coach and will be in charge of team selection. Chapungu public relations officer Tawanda Zowa confirmed the developments and said Dhlakama would be on the bench tomorrow when Waru Waru takes on Nichrut in a Midlands derby. “I can confirm that we have re-engaged Rodwell Dhlakama as Chapungu technical manager with immediate effect. However, Tendai Chikuni remains the head coach and overall in charge of the team. Dhlakama would however, have a say in the team selection, “We will continue monitoring the situation as the season progresses. Otherwise what we have done is to revert back to the same arrangement we had last season,” said Zowa in what could be a demotion for Chikuni. Asked why Dhlakama had left the airmen at the end of last season, Zowa said the former Young Warriors gaffer had a running contract with Zifa Northern Region side Blue Swallows. “He had to go back to Blue Swallows because when we initially hired him he had been contracted by that club. We are reengaging again on the same basis,” he added. However, sources within the Chapungu executive said some members want to see Chikuni out and it will be a matter of time before he is shown the exit door leaving Dhlakama taking full control of the team. The airmen are in the murky relegation waters where they have only managed a paltry eight points in nine points and lie fourth from bottom. Waru Waru have the second highest number of defeats in the league having lost five games and have only won once in as many matches. — @lavuzigara1
