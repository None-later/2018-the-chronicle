Air Commodore Zimondi becomes the substantive director general administration in the Air Force of Zimbabwe, a position he had been holding in acting capacity when he was Group Captain. Conferring the rank to the senior officer, Air Force of Zimbabwe Commander Air Marshal Elson Moyo said he deserved the recognition because he successfully exemplified himself. “This promotion was not done just because you are supposed to be promoted. There are other group captains who were also aspiring to the same rank. It was on merit,” he said. “Promotions come with greater responsibilities and the span of control is actually increased. As an organisation, we believe that you are capable and you are going to deliver the expectations of the organisations. “The promotion comes with added responsibilities and you are expected to provide leadership. I am quite confident that you should be able to meet the challenges which come with the rank.” Air Marshal Moyo also said the force is gender sensitive as the nation is a signatory to the Sadc protocols where it is required to achieve about 30 percent gender balance within every organisation.
