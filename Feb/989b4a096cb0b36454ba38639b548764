 Locadia Mavhudzi, Midlands Correspondent PEOPLE living with disabilities in Gweru have urged Government to expedite the implementation of programmes meant to support and improve their welfare. Speaking at the Annual General Meeting for people living with disabilities in Gweru last week, regional chairperson of the National Council of Disabled Persons of Zimbabwe, Mr Timothy Mpofu said Government programmes aimed at assisting them have been crippled by funding challenges and lack of implementation. “We are calling on the new political dispensation to allocate more resources to the programmes meant to support us. We are tired of vibrant Government plans that go down the drain due to lack of implementation. Government should expedite the implementation of such programmes that improve our welfare,” he said. Mr Mpofu said for example the Public Assistance Fund was benefiting a few people. “The fund should see all disabled people accessing the money because as we speak very few of our members are accessing the $20 fund yet we believe we must be a priority,” he said. “We are failing to access total healthcare because the Assisted Free Medical Treatment facility only facilitates for one to approach Government and council health services which then refer us to private pharmacies and diagnostic centres where we have to pay for the services. We need a universally acceptable medical aid facility for Government and private hospitals.” Gweru Paraplegic and Quadriplegic Association chairperson Ms Audrey Rusike said illegal vendors operating from pavements were making it difficult for people on wheel chairs or walking with the aid of clutches to move in the Central Business District. “The vendors on pavements in town are now threatening our movement as we use wheel chairs and clutches. We continue to urge the city council to clear the pavements so that we can all freely move, “she said.
