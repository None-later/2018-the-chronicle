 Lisa Mangena, Court Reporter A MARRIED police officer from Bulawayo who is refusing to pay maintenance to his “ex-wife”, has been dragged to court. Mr Dalubukhosi Nkomo (32) of Nkulumane suburb is insisting he never married Ms Shyleen Nsingo but admits the two were once lovers. Ms Nsingo, the court heard, brought a five-year-old child to Mr Nkomo’s doorstep long after the two had broken up and said he was the father but he is denying paternity. Western Commonage Magistrate Mrs Tancy Dube ordered the couple to go for a DNA test and return to court on August 3. Mr Nkomo said he was surprised to hear that he had fathered a child with Ms Nsingo. “I had an affair with Ms Nsingo long back and we separated only for her to come now claiming she has my child,” he said. Ms Nsingo told the court that she could not inform Mr Nkomo of the pregnancy because she had lost contact with him after he relocated. “After our break up, I heard that Mr Nkomo had been transferred to another town but could not establish which town,” she said.—@LissahMangena
