 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Basketball Union of Zimbabwe (Buz) will host the Federation of International Basketball Association (Fiba) Level 2 coaching clinic at the Midlands Christian College in Gweru from April 12-18. This will mark the first time Zimbabwe hosts a Level 2 coaching clinic. Fiba Africa instructor Manuel Samuel Carballo will conduct the course. Buz president Joe Mujuru said: “We are very excited to be hosting this clinic for the first time. The hosting of international clinics, such as this one, is in line with our goal of developing the sport in the country. Our coaches need to have the right knowledge to impart to the players,” said Mujuru. “We are excepting a full house for this course. Only those with a Level 1 certificate qualify. This is a full body meeting so we will have participants staying in one place and learning in one place, which gives us ample contact time with the participants,” he said. All provinces, Mujuru said, should send representatives to this high level course so that the game can be professionalised countrywide. “Together with the executive we are working to do away with the prevailing situation whereby basketball is the preserve of Harare and Bulawayo. This is the case both on and off the court. What we need to do is to start working at taking the game, both technically and administratively, to the rest of the country. “Technically, this will create a larger pool of players for our national teams to choose from and this can only make us better on the court. The establishment of national leagues to unlock the market value of the game remains the association’s goal.”
