VP Kembo Mohadi Pamela Shumba, Senior Reporter PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa is a tried and tested leader with the right credentials to see Zimbabwe”s economic turnaround, Vice President Kembo Mohadi has said. Speaking at the occasion to receive equipment for the revival of the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) in Bulawayo on Wednesday, VP Mohadi said President Mnangagwa, who was the guest of honour, had exhibited extreme desire to transform the country’s fortunes, having survived a gruelling path in his political career since colonial times. “He’s a tried and tested leader and we trust and hope as Zimbabweans that he will steer us out of these economic problems,” said VP Mohadi. He said before assuming the office of President, Cde Mnangagwa went through a difficult period including being dressed down during youth interface rallies. “To my surprise he would clap hands, laugh and congratulate those who were actually lambasting him. It takes a man of stature to do that. He’s a patient man and some of us are blessed to serve under him.” As if that was not enough, Cde Mohadi said, at one point during his stint as Vice President of the country, President Mnangagwa’s life was threatened and he had to skip the border as a fugitive. “When the new dispensation, which came into being on November 15 last year was ushered in, the people of Zimbabwe found it necessary that they appoint him as the interim President of the ruling party Zanu-PF and later as President of the country because he has seen it all,” said Cde Mohadi. He urged Zimbabweans to support Cde Mnangagwa’s mantra that “Zimbabwe is open for business”. Cde Mohadi said he worked with President Mnangagwa in Government for more than 30 years hence he was among those who could confidently boast that they know him very well. — @pamelashumba1
