 Nyaradzo Bakari, Chronicle Reporter TWO Bulawayo men were caught pants down while fondling and kissing each other at a sanitary lane in the city, a court heard. Orland Gwarada (29) from Makokoba suburb and Ngqabutho Siqika (24) were caught red-handed by police officers on night patrol while they were half naked and Gwarada’s manhood was inserted between Siqika’s thighs. They were not asked to plead to sodomy charges when they appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Franklin Mkhwananzi. Magistrate Mkhwananzi remanded the duo out of custody to tomorrow on $100 bail each. Prosecuting, Mr Nkathazo Dlodlo said the pair was caught in the act at a sanitary lane along 11th Avenue by Constable Samson Siamunjolo and other police officers who were on patrol duty on Sunday. “On April 15 and at around 4AM, the informant, Samson Siamunjolo and other police officers were on patrol duty along 11th Avenue when they saw the accused persons in a sanitary lane. They went nearer to the accused persons and switched on a cellphone torch. They saw the two half naked, with their pants at ankle level and the accused persons were standing, kissing and fondling. Accused one’s manhood was erect and inserted in between accused two’s thighs,” he said. Mr Dlodlo said the “couple” froze when they realised they had been caught, before dressing a few minutes later.—@NyarieBakie
