Cristiano Ronaldo Cape Town — Cristiano Ronaldo has accepted a two-year suspended prison sentence and a fine of £12.1 million after being found guilty of tax evasion by Spanish tax authorities. According to reports in Spain, Ronaldo has paid the Spanish treasury £12.1 million and will pay £16.8 million in total after striking a deal that will see him not spend any time behind bars. In Spain sentences of two years and under do not carry jail terms and are served rather on probation. The Spanish Treasury had accused the 33-year-old of “voluntarily and consciously” failing to pay £12.8 million in tax on earnings generated by his image rights between 2011-2014. La Liga president Javier Tebas has claimed that the Portuguese attacker’s move to Juventus was motivated by money. “He will earn more money (there) than here. I think that fiscally it favours him to go to Italy. Here, in Spain, we have a problem with fiscal competition.” The Spanish tax rate for footballers is at 52% compared to 46% in Italy. Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo stunned staff at a Greek resort by leaving a huge £17 850 (R313 000) tip after being impressed by their service while on holiday with his family. After Portugal’s exit from the 2018 Soccer World Cup the 33-year-old headed to the Costa Navarino resort in the Peloponnese region of Greece with family and friends. Reports suggest that Ronaldo gifted the staff of the resort with the mega tip as a thank you before heading to Turin for his unveiling as a Juventus player. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner asked hotel management to split the figure equally among all staff.  — Sport24.
