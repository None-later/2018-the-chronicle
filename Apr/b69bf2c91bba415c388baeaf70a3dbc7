The late Mr Albert Ncube Thandiwe Katinhimure, Business Reporter BULAWAYO United Public Transport Association (Bupta) administrator, Mr Albert Ncube, has died. He was 56. Mr Ncube succumbed to a stroke last Friday while he was driving in the Central Business District in Bulawayo. Bupta finance director, Mr Keeper Ndlovu, described Ncube’s death as sudden and unexpected saying he looked physically fit before suffering a stroke. “I had spoken to him via the phone that same morning inquiring about a soccer match we had planned to attend together. He declined attending the match saying he had other errands to work on,” said Mr Ndlovu. “He stroked whilst driving and he hit other cars as it happened. He then got help and I was contacted. I also called guys at the rank where I fortunately got hold of his son who rushed and took him to Corporate 24 private hospital.” The late Ncube was admitted and later transferred to Mater Dei Hospital where he passed on early Monday morning. “Ncube has left a huge gap in the transport industry as he played a pivotal role in bringing sanity and order in the transport sector in Bulawayo,” said Mr Ndlovu. Ncube was born on the 8 June 1961 and he is survived by three sons; Phathisani, Thamu and Musa. Before venturing into the transport business, he worked in the education sector as a headmaster in both Zimbabwe and Botswana. Mourners are gathered at Number 1 Churchill Crescent, Richmond. Burial is earmarked for tomorrow (Saturday). — @thandyfeminine.
