 Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter PREPARATIONS for the Zimbabwe Under-17 Cosafa tournament are behind schedule by a week, according to head coach Tafadzwa Mashiri. This year’s tournament will be held in Mauritius from July 19-29 and the Young Warriors are in Group C alongside Angola, Malawi and Swaziland. “We have submitted our plans to Zifa and we are behind by a week, but we hope to go into camp soon,” said Mashiri. Mashiri, who said he was in the process of finalising his squad in preparation for the camping period, took over from Moses Chunga, who was in charge of the team last year when it failed to record a single win in three matches. There will be a record 12 teams for this year’s jamboree and Group A contains hosts Mauritius, Botswana, 2016 champions Namibia and Seychelles. Group B promises to be a hard-fought one with defending champions Zambia up against regional powerhouse South Africa, Mozambique and Lesotho. Group C also looks unpredictable with Zimbabwe, Angola, Malawi and Swaziland. There will be a total of 22 matches, 18 in the first-round group stage, two semi-finals, a third-place play-off and the final. The championship serves as a qualifier for the 2019 African Under-17 Championships to be played in Tanzania. The continental tourney serves as a qualifier for the 2019 Fifa Under-17 World Cup.
