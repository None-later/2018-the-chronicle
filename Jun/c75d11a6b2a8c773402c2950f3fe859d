 Nkosilathi Sibanda in Mutare MR PACE runner Canisious Nyamutsika won the men’s Tanganda Half Marathon in record time of one hour five minutes at Mutare Sports Club yesterday. The women’s run was lifted by Caroline Mhandu in one hour 21 minutes and six seconds. Nyamutsika has taken part in the Tanganda race since 2012 but had been finding it hard to outpace veterans of the route. This time he made easy strides over favourites such as Misheck Sithole, who finished second in one hour six minutes and six seconds. Sithole was the Tanganda winner in 2017. Policeman Munyaradzi Jere was third in the men’s category in a time of one hour six minutes and 34 seconds, while Ethel Sibanda was second in the women’s race. In the wheelchair section, Elford Moyo exerted his six-year dominance in the 21.1km race. This year’s edition had a number of athletes from outside the country who however could not navigate the undulating route with ease. Owing to the chilly morning weather, athletes found it easy to stride but many gave in to fatigue after the 15km peg. For Nyamutsika, it seemed an easy task as he led from the start, outpacing Olympian Wirimai Juwao and Munyaradzi Jere. The winner broke away from the leading pack with two kilometres left. He attributed his triumph to a rigorous training routine and support from his team Mr Pace. “If it was not for the training I did with fellow teammates, I would not have made it,” said Nyamutsika. His next assignment is the Econet Victoria Falls Marathon this coming Sunday. “I have set my sights on the Econet Marathon in Victoria Falls as I want to win that race,” he said.
