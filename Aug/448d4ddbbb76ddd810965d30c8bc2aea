Amkela Dube Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter KEZI’s Bango area comes alive next Saturday when four teams battle it out in a football tournament sponsored by four Zimbabweans who are based in the United Kingdom. St Joseph’s FC, Mambale, Khalanyoni and Bango Swallows will battle it out in the competition meant to motivate aspiring footballers from the area to take the sport seriously. Spokesman for the organisers, Amkela Dube, who is also one of the sponsors, said they want the competition to be an annual event. “The tournament is being sponsored by myself, Clayton Vundla, Obey Maphosa and Siza Ndebele. “We decided to come together as people in the diaspora and sponsor the teams from our communities so as to promote social cohesion and eradicate crime, stop abuse of alcohol and anti-social behaviour. “The tournament will be staged at Bango Semukwe Bridge under Chief Bango. This will be the first time we hold such a tournament but definitely it won’t be the last time. “We are planning to make it an annual event which is going to be hosted in rotation among the four teams,” said Dube. The winners of the competition will pocket R4 000, with the losing finalists getting R1 500 while third place playoff winners will get R250. Dube said they will conduct a draw on Saturday morning and the competition will be played in a knockout format. — @ZililoR
