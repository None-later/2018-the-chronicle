Dr Parirenyatwa Thandeka Moyo, Health Reporter THE Ministry of Health and Child Care has received 63 resuscitation machines from Nestlé Nutrition Institute Africa that will help district hospitals reduce neonatal deaths. In a statement, Health and Child Care Minister Dr David Parirenyatwa (pictured) said the donated equipment all worth $7 000 will go a long way in addressing neonatal deaths or the death of a new-born during the first 28 days of life. “It is my pleasure to receive the 63 neonatal resuscitation kits from Nestlé Nutrition Institute Africa. This signifies great private sector support aimed at reducing the national neonatal morbidity and mortality rates,” said Dr Parirenyatwa. “In line with the global goals, we need to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 3 target, which states that all countries should aim to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1 000 live births by 2030.” Dr Parirenyatwa said although the current neonatal mortality rate is 29 per 1 000 live births, the SDG goal can be achieved through public private partnerships. “We have a long way to go, but we believe that through such private sector support as witnessed from Nestle the target can be achieved,” he said. “We would like to thank the Nestlé Nutrition Institute Africa for heeding our call and providing 63 neonatal resuscitation kits valued at $7 000 to be used for the training of healthcare professionals at each district hospital nationwide.” The Minister said according to the World Health Organisation the first 28 days of life – the neonatal period – represents the most vulnerable time for a child’s survival. “According to the WHO in 2016, 2.6 million deaths, or roughly 46 percent of all under-five deaths, occurred during this period,” said Dr Parirenyatwa. @thamamoe
