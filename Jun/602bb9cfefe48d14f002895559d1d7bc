 Showbiz Correspondent FIFTEEN prisoners received recording contracts after coming out tops at the Inside Out finale held at Khami Prison Complex last week. Inside Out is a talent show run by the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) to rehabilitate and reintegrate prisoners into society through arts. According to Inside Out organiser Clarence “Kirah” Garura, who is the ZPCS Arts and Rehab Ambassador for Bulawayo Metropolitan province, the 15 were drawn from five categories namely poetry, dance, drama/comedy, contemporary music and acapella. He said the prisoners would record their works at his Kirah Music & Media stable. “The 15 won recording deals ranging from full albums to singles as well as the shooting of short films all courtesy of Kirah Music & Media. Furthermore, they won toiletry hampers courtesy of Full Gospel Church and the National Aids Council,” said Kirah. He described the Inside Out finals as a big success with 39 inmates having gone through intense grilling and fitness programmes. The organisers are now looking forward to next year’s edition of the talent show which they said would definitely be bigger.
