ZIMBABWEAN cricket all-rounder Sikandar Raza will join Karachi Kings in the fourth blockbuster edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) to be played in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from February 14 to March 17 next year. In a Twitter post, Raza said he is delighted to be joining Karachi Kings for the 2019 season. “Overwhelmed by all the messages I have received. Thank you @KarachiKingsARY and @Salman_ARY for this opportunity to be part of @the PSLt20. Extremely delighted but also short of words to describe how I feel,” he wrote. The PSL season is a Twenty20 cricket league which was founded in 2015 and runs between the months of February and March, with six teams playing matches in double round robin format. The top four teams with the best record qualify for the playoffs and culminate in the championship game, the PSL Cup Final. Born in Sialkot, Pakistan, Raza made his debut for Zimbabwe in May 2013. He was adjudged man-of-the-series in the ICC World Cup Qualifiers in March this year. A right-handed batsman and a right-arm spin bowler, a perfect all-rounder for the team with a proven track record, Raza becomes one of the most experienced and big names in the PSL. — @khumzallen
