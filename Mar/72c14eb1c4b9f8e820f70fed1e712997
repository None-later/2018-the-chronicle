 Nigeria has produced a new movie titled Wakanda Forever, a spin-off of the superhero movie, Black Panther. And Nollywood’s answer to Black Panther is full of drama and a hilarious talking snake. Black Panther is set in a fictional African nation called Wakanda. The Wakanda Forever 1 and 2 series, released in full on YouTube last week, takes place in a fictional Nigerian kingdom, ostensibly the Wakanda of “Black Panther”, and explores Nigerian voodoo magic. It features a typically Nollywood low-tech speaking snake, which bites the head off  from one of the lead characters in the opening scene. “Wakanda Forever” – which has become a global symbol of Black power and solidarity is the salute of the people of Wakanda – is gradually winning the attention of a global audiences desperate to connect with the African continent. It has already been viewed more than 30 000 times and could actually be an old Nollywood film that has been retitled to make the most of the Black Panther madness which broke the $1-billion mark in cinemas last week. Marvel’s Black Panther received global attention for its great storyline and the representation of black power and solidarity. Already, some movie enthusiasts in Ghana have predicted the production of a Ghanaian version of the movie by the Twi-speaking film industry usually referred to as Kumawood. – HuffingtonPost
