Cde Abednico Ncube Thandeka Moyo, Chronicle Reporter MATABELELAND South Provincial Affairs Minister Cde Abednico Ncube yesterday commissioned Fugwe bridge in Irisvale, Umzingwane district which is set to reduce the number of children who miss school due to flooded rivers. The bridge will also help villagers living across Insezi River access a nearby clinic. Speaking before commissioning the bridge yesterday, Minister Ncube said the District Development Fund (DDF) had facilitated the construction of many bridges since the 100 Day plan was launched under the new dispensation. “This bridge will make a difference in the lives of the surrounding communities who will now be able to access both sides of the river especially the side where Irisvale Clinic is situated,” said Minister Ncube. He said school children will now access Irisvale Secondary School without taking a long and tiresome detour through Mbalabala during the rainy season. Minister Ncube said the bridge will also facilitate transport and business operations in the area and beyond.  The construction of the bridge is among the many development projects that DFF is implementing to uplift the living standards of the people in rural areas. Cde Ncube said Government wants all rural communities to be linked to urban areas and other service centres.  The Minister said DDF was working on a number of projects in different parts of the province and these include the construction of Lukange, Dumba and Siyoka bridges in Beitbridge which are almost complete. In Insiza district, the DDF is working on Lower Nkankezi bridge and Epoch Mine road. Completed bridges will soon be commissioned in both Matobo and Mangwe districts. Mr Douglas Dube who heads DDF in Matabeleland South said communities were complementing Government efforts by providing free labour. He said the Government and the communities had joined hands to address the problem of failing to cross rivers during the rainy season. @thamamoe
