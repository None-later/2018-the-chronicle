As harmonised elections grip the nation, I say no to tearing or defacing political campaign posters, banners etc. — Lovemore Kashawo, Harare It seems former DeMbare players and coaches are now dominating coaching other teams in the local league. ZPC Kariba, Harare City, Ngezi Platinum and Triangle. Will these former players not decide the fate of DeMbare even during a season they are performing badly like now? – Lovemore Kashawo, Harare My name is Munashe Leslie Moyo. I am looking for my father whose name is Grey Moyo who last worked at Ingutsheni hospital. I last heard from him in 2006 and his last known address is block 69, 2135 in Mpopoma in Bulawayo. For any information about him please contact me at Embakwe Boys High school in Plumtree. – Munashe Leslie Moyo The current crop of Chevrons could be the worst. Team selection is amiss. Players must be selected on merit rather than merely having been around for ages. Most of these players are a failure. It is high time those responsible for selection bite the bullet and brought in some changes. — Nesongano.
