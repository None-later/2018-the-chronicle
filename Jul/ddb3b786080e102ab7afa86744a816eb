 I wish POTRAZ could revisit the internet charges once again, for the way the same amount of bundles that we used to spend up to a week, sometimes even failing to finish them, are now running out in three days? Something is fishy here? NetOne should be investigated. — Disappointed Customer With the frequent accidents on our roads, I hope more trains and more train routes will be introduced.  Trains are safer and chances of accidents are few and those who prefer using trains will have a choice.  They are also cheap. Yes, there are trains plying our rail routes but I believe they are few and do not cover most areas. I think we need more trains and railway routes to cover if possible the whole country.  One advantage I like about trains is that besides electric trains they do not normally move fast and have fewer chances of colliding. – Farai “Mashasha” Chisango This is an open letter to our President of Zimbabwe, Cde Emmerson Mnangagwa.  Can he please do away with the water debts we accumulated under Mr Robert Mugabe’s era, then we start in our New Zimbabwe!  Under Mugabe we were never free. — Worried Resident, Bulawayo
