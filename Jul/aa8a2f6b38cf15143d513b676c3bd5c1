 Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Gwanda Correspondent A 40-YEAR-OLD Maphisa mine worker has been jailed for 20 years for raping his neighbour’s five-year-old daughter. The man, who works as a general worker at Malinga Mine pleaded not guilty but was convicted due to overwhelming evidence when he appeared before Gwanda regional magistrate, Mr Mark Dzira facing rape charges. “You committed a serious offence, one which is despicable in fact. You are a danger to the community as you target young innocent children. This child’s life has been affected by your actions. “Such behaviour isn’t expected from a man your age because I assume you are a father and you know how disheartening it is for someone to sexually abuse your child. You deserve a deterrent sentence which will serve as a lesson for like-minded people therefore I sentence you to an effective 20 years,” said Mr Dzira. Prosecuting, Mr Pearson Chekeya said the girl who is an ECD B pupil was left by her mother playing with other children at Malinga Mine compound and the man from the nearby house took advantage of the situation to rape her. “On 1 May the juvenile was playing with other children at Malinga Mine compound, left by her mother who had gone to Maphisa Business Centre. He then called all the children into his bedroom hut he later chased them away and remained with the girl. “He placed her on his bed and raped her. During the process a teenager from the area arrived and found him committing the offence which forced him to stop. When the girl’s mother returned the teenager revealed what had happened. The matter was reported to the police resulting in his arrest,” said Mr Chekeya.— @DubeMatutu
