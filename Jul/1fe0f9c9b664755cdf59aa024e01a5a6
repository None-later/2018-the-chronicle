 The wife of a pervert who filmed customers in a KFC loo has told of the horrific moment she found the footage. Mollie Clarke (21) thought Richard Cooper (26) was glued to his phone because he was having an affair. Instead, the fast food worker had fixed his mobile to a bin to spy on diners thought to be as young as five. Cooper had also secretly filmed his wife at home. Devastated Mollie, who has waived her anonymity to talk, went straight to police after stumbling across the videos after Cooper left his phone on charge. She said: “It was the worst moment of my life. I felt physically sick, I thought I was going to throw up.” But Cooper, who targeted KFC customers in Coleraine, Northern Ireland, dodged jail when his case came to court last month. He was convicted of four counts of voyeurism and given two years probation after pleading guilty at Antrim Crown Court. Mollie said: “He’s a danger to the public. I can’t believe I married someone so sick.” — The Mirror
