 Lovemore Zigara in Gweru WHAWHA ran riot at the weekend, whipping Ivan Hoe 4-1 in the Zimbabwe General Medical Aid Fund encounter played at Whawha Grounds. A brace apiece by Raymond Horonga and Gift Phiri gave the prisons and correctional services side maximum points, while former Shabanie Mine striker Farai Mususunye scored the Kwekwe-based gold miners’ consolation. The win leaves Whawha at the top of the table with 13 points from six games, a point ahead of second-placed Telone, who saw off Black Eagles 2 – 0. Whawha coach Luke Petros-Jukulile said he wants to ensure his charges maintain consistency. “It was a game which we really needed to maximise, especially after the loss to MSU at home which was a major setback for us. “We just need to continue working hard and see where it will take us. “If we maintain consistency, we will be in with a chance, but of course it is still too early to talk about the championship,” said Petros-Jukulile. His Ivan Hoe counterpart Julius Chakupewa said they need to pick themselves up and start picking up points. “Last year we were doing so well, especially away from home, but this time around the opposite is true. “However, it is still early days and we should start picking up points. “We are not far off because with seven points between us and the log leaders, we can still mount a challenge,” he said. Elsewhere, army side Tongogara picked up their first win of the season when they beat MSU 1-0 at Battlefields through Maxwell Muzondo’s 70th minute goal. Kelvin Maphosa, the Tongogara coach, said his side need to maintain the momentum. “What we need is to maintain the momentum by keeping on winning all our games and hopefully we will catch up with the others,” he said.
