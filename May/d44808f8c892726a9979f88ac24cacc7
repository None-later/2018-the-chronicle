 Nyaradzo Bakari, Chronicle Reporter TWO men from Bulawayo have been arrested for allegedly using fake money to pay for a fuel refill at a city service station. Ngqabutho Lunga (24) and Mgcini Mahlangu (25) both from Cowdray Park suburb allegedly defrauded a fuel attendant from Glow Petroleum service station, Mr Simbarashe Gowora and used a fake $50 note to pay for fuel. The court heard that the duo was given $45 bond notes change after paying for $5 fuel. They allegedly sped off after Mr Gowora realised the money was fake and confronted them. Lunga and Mahlangu appeared before Bulawayo Magistrate Mr Sheunesu Matova facing theft charges. They pleaded not guilty and were remanded out of custody to Tuesday for provision of a trial date. Prosecuting, Mr Maclean Ndlovu saidthe duo swindled Glow Petroleum of US$50 in April. They were, however, unlucky to be captured on CCTV camera, leading to their arrest. “On April 19 at around 9PM, the accused persons were driving a silver Honda fit. They went to Glow Petroleum along Plumtree road and bought $5 fuel. The accused persons gave the complainant US$50,” Mr Matova said. The pair initially refused to be given bond notes as change but later agreed and were given $45. “On verifying the authenticity of the money, the complainant discovered that the money was fake. He advised both accused persons who did not seem bothered about the issue and just drove away. The complainant immediately went to check the CCTV and got the vehicle registration number, leading to the suspects’ arrest,” the prosecutor said. Glow Petroleum lost $50 and it was not recovered. @NyarieBakie
