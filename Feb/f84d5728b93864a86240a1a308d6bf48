The artists who include Ras Caleb from the Victoria Falls RASTA Compassion, an organisation that was formed in 2015 to help the needy, said the event will be held at Invuvu Sports Bar in the resort town. Spokesperson, King Dani said hosting these shows was their way of giving back to the community which supports their careers. “Our organisation has no donor hence this decision to fundraise so that we assist the elderly in our community,” he said. Dani said the beneficiairies will be drawn from areas like Sidobe, Monde, Sizinda, Chisuma, Lupinyu which surround Victoria Falls. In December last year, the RASTA Compassion treated the elderly at Chinotimba Old People’s Home to an early Christmas after they hosted a luncheon and also donated 10 reading glasses. Dani said another source of revenue for their organisation was the monthly subscription fees paid by members. @nyathi_nothabo
