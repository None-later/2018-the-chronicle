The late Roger Russell Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Zimbabwe Saints fitness trainer and well known personality in Bulawayo, Roger Russell, has died. He was 57. According to his last born daughter and family spokesperson, Laura, Russell passed away at Mater de Hospital yesterday morning, six hours after being admitted at the health institution after complaining of a sore arm. “We are still trying to come to grips with my dad’s demise, it’s unbelievable. We have lost a loving and caring person in our lives who was also a strategist and in some sense a disciplinarian,” said Laura. Former Zimbabwe Saints player and coach Gibson Homela expressed shock and disbelief at the sudden death of Russell. “He came to Zimbabwe Saints in the late 1980s as our physical trainer and I immediately admired his style as he was a no-nonsense kind of guy, who did things out of love. I am truly at a loss for words as to what really went wrong and I would personally like to convey my condolences to his family and the entire Chikwata family,” said Homela. Former Zifa acting president Vincent Pamire also expressed his sadness at Russel’s passing. “I’m getting the news from you as we speak and I am shocked and honestly hurt,” said Pamire in a brief telephone interview from Harare. Besides his love for football, he was also a businessman who ran a fabrication company in the city and a committed Rotarian and was once president of the Bulawayo South Rotary Club. His death comes barely a few days after he celebrated his 33rd wedding anniversary. Funeral arrangements will be announced after the arrival of his first born daughter Melisa from South Africa today. He is survived by wife Norah and two daughters, Melisa and Laura. Mourners are gathered at 34 St Helens Road, Parklands, Bulawayo. — @skhumoyo2000
