Tobias Mandoreba in Hwange THE Hwange Junior Soccer League was launched at Lwendulu old ground in the coal mining town on Saturday as Chipangano seek to redeem themselves through a return to vibrant junior football development. Lwendulu East and West, Lusumbami, Baobab, Ralyton, Cinderella and Makwika will each have Under-13 and Under-17 teams in the league sponsored by Hwange Colliery Company that is expected to kick-off in mid-February. The league’s sole purpose is to produce players for the Hwange FC senior team. Guest of honour, regional magistrate Collet Ncube, urged young footballers to aim high in the game. “This opportunity brought to you by Hwange FC is a chance for you as young footballers to showcase your talents and to be role models in the community when you become recognised football stars through hard work and dedication. In the same vein, I am urging other corporates in the district and province to emulate Hwange Colliery Company in promoting football as it is now a rewarding career if taken seriously, “ said Ncube. Former Hwange player and coach Weekly Mwale took delegates down memory lane. “WAFA league was vibrant from around the late 1960s to early 2000 and Hwange didn’t need to buy players from outside. We must go back to that system for us to return to the topflight. Stars produced from that system include the likes of Leonard Tembo, Isaac Phiri, Skevah Phiri, Jimmy Sibanda, Posani Sibanda (late), Amos Rendo, Chutika Tembo, Nathan Madhuku, Nyaro Mumba, Barton Mwalukuka and Kakoma Kayonga. They brought silverware such as the Nyore Nyore Cup, Castle Cup and Castro Heroes Cup,” he said. Mwale is coordinating the league alongside another ex-Hwange player Milos Phiri. — @tobymandox
