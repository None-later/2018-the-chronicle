Minister Perrance Shiri Midlands Bureau All is set for the annual Gweru Agricultural Show, which starts tomorrow. The four-day event will be officially opened by Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement Perrance Shiri. The show will run from August 16 to August 19 under the theme “steering the economy to vibrancy”. When our Midlands Bureau visited the show grounds yesterday, exhibitors were putting final touches to their stands. In an interview, Midlands Show Society chairperson, Mr Augustine Mpakurirwa, called upon businesses and stakeholders to work together. He said the show gave exhibitors a rare chance to showcase their products to consumers. “This is a brilliant opportunity for exhibitors to showcase and parade their products,” said Mr Mpakurirwa. “As the Midlands Show society, we would like to urge businesses and stakeholders to work together in developing the economy.” Mr Mpakurirwa said as the show society, they had put in place all necessary logistics to ensure the successful hosting of the show. “As you have seen, participants are already busy decorating their stands while as a society we have put in place all necessary logistics to ensure the successful hosting of the show,” he said. Mr Mpakurirwa said the response from the business community was encouraging. “We are very happy about the overwhelming response we are getting from the business community,” he said. “People are eager to take up stands and the number has been increasing over the years. We are very grateful for the support they have given us.” In 2017, 165 companies took part at the show, while more than 180 companies are expected to exhibit this year. The Gweru Agriculture show was initially penciled for July 26-29, and had to be moved due to the just ended harmonised elections.
