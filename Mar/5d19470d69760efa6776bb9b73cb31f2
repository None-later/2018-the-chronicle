Brendan Taylor. Picture: ZimCric Mehluli Sibanda, Senior Sports Reporter HALF centuries by senior batsmen Brendan Taylor and Hamilton Masakadza led Zimbabwe to a seven wicket win over Papua New Guinea with 57 balls to spare in an ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier warm-up match at Bulawayo Athletic Club yesterday. Masakadza made 54, while Taylor contributed 52 before both batsmen retired, as Zimbabwe scored 196 for five in 40.3 overs. PNG won the toss and elected to bat, with their opening pair of Vani Morea and Lega Siaka scoring 36 runs for the opening stand in their total of 195 in 49.4 overs. Morea top scored for the Pacific islanders with 58 runs. Off-spinner Sikandar Raza was outstanding with the ball, taking two wickets for 20 runs in 10 overs. There were also two wickets apiece for left-arm spinner Tendai Chisoro and Blessing Muzarabani. In their run chase, Zimbabwe lost Cephas Zhuwao for 11 runs, dismissed by leg-spinner Mahuru Dai. Fellow opener Solomon Mire, Masakadza and Taylor brought some stability to the run chase. Craig Ervine ended unbeaten on 22, while Peter Moor was also unbeaten on 13, as Zimbabwe recorded a convincing win. It was Zimbabwe’s only warm-up match after their clash with Ireland was abandoned due to a waterlogged outfield at Queens Sports Club on Tuesday. The victory will be a huge morale booster for the Chevrons ahead of the tournament on Sunday. Zimbabwe open their campaign with a clash against ICC World Cricket League Division Two runners-up Nepal at Queens Sports Club. — @Mdawini_29
