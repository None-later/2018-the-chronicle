 Descent Dube, Sports Reporter THE SPAR Bonsa T20 League matches continue on Sunday with three games lined up at the Old Mutual Heath Streak Cricket Academy. Blazers take on the Tigers in a middle of the table clash hoping to make it three wins in the five-week-old league. Tigers’ last outing saw them losing to Badgers. Tigers are expected to apply pressure on the Blazers’ batsmen with Matabeleland Tuskers bowlers John Nyumbu and Steve Chimamiyo leading the attack. Table topping Badgers feature in the second game against log anchors Sabres, who have been unlucky not to win more of their matches, as they have run all previous opponents close. Week 5 matches will be capped by an encounter between the Hawks and Raptors, who will both be fighting to move up the table in the last round of head to head matches. Both teams will be fighting hard to create momentum before the league moves to its play-off stages.
