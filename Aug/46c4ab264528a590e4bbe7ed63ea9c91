Chief Insp Simango said the names of the deceased were being withheld as their next of keen were yet to be contacted. “The first party was driving a white Toyota Hilux Double Cab travelling due East while the second party was driving a PSV Iveco with an unstated number of passengers on board due West. The third party was driving a white Jasbro Foods Mazda 323 due East,” she said. Chief Insp Simango said the driver of the Iveco vehicle tried to overtake a haulage truck and was involved in a head-on collision with the Toyota Hilux.

Chief Insp Simango blamed the accident on an overtaking error. She said police did not find the driver of the Iveco when they arrived at the accident scene and were therefore looking for him.
