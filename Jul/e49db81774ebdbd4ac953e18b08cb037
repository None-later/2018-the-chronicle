Tendai Mtawarira explains scrum techniques to Milton High School pupils Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter CELEBRATED rugby star, Tendai “Beast” Mtawarira, made a surprise visit to Milton High School’s first team rugby, the Milton Elephants, and gave a motivational talk and held a mini training session at the school on Tuesday. Mtawarira, who became the sixth and first black African and specialist prop to reach 100 caps for South Africa’s Springboks, quietly sneaked into Bulawayo and conducted a training session for the Milton team. Tendai Machawira, Milton High School’s sports director, described the Beast’s visit as “memorable” for the boys and believes it will go a long way in inspiring the budding rugby stars. “Everyone was excited to have an internationally acclaimed rugby great in the form of Mtawarira visiting us for our session. His visit was meant to motivate the boys, give them tips to help them shape their rugby careers since he has walked down that path,” said Machawira. “The boys were really surprised and at the same time excited by the memorable experience of being coached by the Beast. His presence interested the boys and they are still talking about the Beast’s visit,” he said. Machawira said Mtawarira’s visit and mini training session was made possible by Shasha Gomez, the school’s rugby team sponsor. He said the Beast’s visit came at the right time when the Milton Elephants were preparing for a league game against Churchill High in Harare this afternoon. “It is our hope that the Beast’s visit will inspire the boys when they travel to Harare for the game against Churchill. We will also be going to represent Bulawayo at the Nash Rugby Championships in Mutare in August,” Machawira said. Milton are the Bulawayo boys’ rugby champions and prop Sovereign Mwanyenya was selected for the Zimbabwe Under-19 squad. Centre Takudzwa Sithole and fullback Daiton Phiri are among the players that have been outstanding for the Milton Elephants this year. — @ZililoR
