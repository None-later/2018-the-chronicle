ExQ Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent SHORT and sweet leaving you asking for more is what rapper ExQ gave fans as a performance on Friday at Club Cosmopolitan in Bulawayo. Mr Putiti as ExQ calls himself these days came to the club riding on his runaway hit Nhema that features Zim dancehall star Killer T. Dubbed the Free Spirit Friday, this is what most fans had come to watch him perform live with DJ Tamuka. However, they had to wait until the end of his set as ExQ went through his old ballads during the Urban Grooves days such as Mazirudo, Maidei and others. Although the nostalgia for fans was good, this affected his live performance although DJ Tamuka helped him with backing vocals. However, when it comes to tracks such as Bhachura where he featured Ammara Brown, it became difficult for him to sing her parts leaving the female fans in the crowd to sing along. Their set was 45 minutes and they left the stage and nightclub shortly afterwards. However, the antics on stage at Club Cosmopolitan were just a small part of the revelry that was happening in the nightspot. DJ Tamuka The vibe at Cosmopolitian is what people flock to the club to enjoy as it has become the place to be for those who feel stylish and want to have fun in an upmarket club. The VIP areas have become the centre of attraction and a battle ground for who is best dressed and who buys the most expensive beverage on the night. Bottle sparklers were seen going towards the VIP area at regular intervals with pricy champagne which was being guzzledÂ  by thirsty revellers as the night wore on. Beautiful, smartly dressed women in high heels were the order of the day and the vibe in the club was good.
