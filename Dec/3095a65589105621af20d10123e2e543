The Chronicle Response Twitter Response to, “ED declares National Clean-Up Day”. This deserves the nation’s support. Let’s clean our land, clean the environment, and clean our minds. Let’s keep our backyards clean! – Bandaful. Facebook Response to “Government moves in to abolish death penalty”. Death penalty no. Let them die in prison. – Lloyd Banda. Response to “Canada speaks on Zim”. The voice of the people is the voice of God. God gave us our leader President Mnangagwa. November 2017 was a turning point in Zimbabwe’s history. The people of Zimbabwe went onto the streets to have their voices heard. They called for freedom, progress and a new way of doing things. This was a process of transforming Zanu-PF into a new dispensation under the leadership of President Mnangagwa. Zanu-PF heard the people’s call, shared their vision and is committed to deliver. People, let’s support this new era (new Zimbabwe). God has given us a second chance. God wanted to open the President’s eyes to see what is wrong and what is good. We can’t be waffling around going against him, no! It doesn’t help! God has given ED a second chance. Let’s give Zimbabwe a second chance like what God did to us! It’s a favour, let’s accept it! Zimbabwe belongs to God and it’s him returning this country to prosperity. All governments have been put in place by God. So those who refuse to obey the laws of the land are refusing to obey God, and punishment will follow. It’s time for us Zimbabweans to pray for our leaders. Let’s rally behind them. Together we will build a Zimbabwe we all want. If you lose, accept defeat and move on. Power is in God’s hands. Refusing to accept defeat and move on will be costly. You need to trust in your Lord only. We know how sanctions destroy nations. Sanctions is not an economic term, it is witchcraft. It means whatever power you have will not work for you regardless of who is in power. – Kudakwashe Bangwayo.
