Mr Samuel Undenge Harare Bureau FORMER Energy and Power Development Minister Dr Samuel Undenge’s two children studying at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, have been ejected from campus over failure to pay fees. Bongai Tafadzwa Undenge (third year) and Kumbirai Christian Undenge (second year) have failed to register for the new semester that started last month over arrear fees in excess of R140 000. The two should also raise fees amounting to R60 000 each for the new semester. They have since been served with a 72-hour notice to vacate the university campus if they do not pay the required fees, which has since lapsed. The High Court has heard that while the politician’s two biological children were suffering, his step children were living a luxurious life at European universities. The pair’s mother, Mrs Angeline Undenge, has filed an urgent chamber application at the High Court on behalf of the children seeking an order compelling the politician to pay the fees. Mrs Undenge was formerly married to Dr Undenge, but their union was terminated in 2006. Dr Undenge then married his new wife, Letina. The politician lost his ministerial position when President Mnangagwa announced the new Cabinet in December last year. The High Court, in another court case involving Dr Undenge’s daughter, ruled that the politician must pay for the children’s fees despite the fact that they would have attained 18 years. Mrs Undenge said her children were being unfairly treated. “Because of respondent’s failing to pay the sums highlighted above, the college has now cancelled or withdrawn the housing offer and has now demanded that applicants move out of the college within 72 hours,” reads her affidavit. She said the children had not been attending lectures since February 19 this year after failing to meet the 2018 first semester registration deadline by February 16. Mrs Undenge stated in the court papers that the politician was in contempt of court.
