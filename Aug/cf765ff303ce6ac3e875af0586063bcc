 AFTER holding Absa Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns to a 1-1 draw on Saturday, Kaizer Chiefs forward Khama Billiat feels there is still room for improvement. Billiat signed for Amakhosi in a shock off-season move after ending a five-year stint at Masandawana and he impressed against his former side and was named man-of-the-match. “Firstly, I want to thank God for this opportunity and the supporters who have come in numbers,” Billiat said on SuperSport after the match. “I know it has been tough for the past three seasons, but it’s water under the bridge and we’re ready to start the league.” On the team’s performance, the Zimbabwean said: “It was a tough match, (Sundowns) is a good side. I think we have done a lot of things we wanted to do and there’s still room for improvement. I want to thank my teammates, the club and coach for those opportunities.” Although he felt that the game could have been better, Billiat insisted that Amakhosi would not be too self-critical. “We created not as many (chances) as we wanted to, but there were moments where we could’ve taken our chances, but it’s a learning curve. “We learn every day. We take it positively. We are not too hard on ourselves , we take it one game as it comes.” Chiefs’ next game will be against Wits at FNB Stadium, with the kick-off scheduled for 19:30 today. — Sport24.co.za.
