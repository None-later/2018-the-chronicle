One of the machines commissioned at Mpilo Central Hospital’s Department of Radiography yesterday Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter MPILO Central Hospital yesterday commissioned two more X-ray and CT scan machines that had been lying idle for more than three years due to lack of working space. The hospital has been renovating the X-ray centre in preparation for the installation of the new machines which were delivered to the health institution in March 2015. The machines were donated by the Government to capacitate the referral hospital and improve access to basic medical equipment. Dr Solwayo Ngwenya, the hospital’s clinical director, yesterday said the hospital had completed renovations at the X-ray centre that were done in preparation for the installation of the new machines. “We are opening as from June 12 (yesterday), two extra X-ray machines and a CT Scan in the Department of Radiography. This will increase our capacity to attend to our patients’ needs and improve service delivery at the hospital. “The machines will go a long way in reducing the number of patients that have to be referred to other health centres for X-rays. They will also help patients get their test results faster,” he said. Dr Ngwenya advised members of the public that only consultants would be allowed to request scans. “Please note that for CT scans only consultants are allowed to request scans and must clearly sign the forms, otherwise the department of radiography will reject them,” he said. A computerised tomography (CT scan) uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body. CT scans can produce detailed images of many structures inside the body including the internal organs, blood vessels and bones, allowing radiographers to diagnose conditions such as damage to bones, injuries to internal organs, problems with blood flow, strokes and cancer. — @winnie_masara
