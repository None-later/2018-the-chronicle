 Lisa Mangena, Court Reporter A MAN from Bulawayo has been arrested for allegedly stealing 10 000 rand from his usiphatheleni neighbour in Mzilikazi suburb. Learnmore Gwetese of Sotshangane Flats got into Ms Fiona Jobane’s house at around 7PM and broke the bedroom padlock at a time when she was not at home before stealing the money. A court heard that Gwetese is a friend to Ms Jobane’s son and had spare keys to the main door. Gwetese pleaded guilty to theft before Bulawayo Magistrate Ms Nyaradzo Ringisai who remanded him to August 16. Prosecuting, Mr Nkhatazo Dlodlo said the accused person used spare keys to enter Ms Jobane’s house last week on Wednesday. “Upon entering the house, Gwetese went to the bedroom where he broke the padlock and got into the room,” he added. Mr Dlodlo said two days before he stole the money, Gwetese got into the complainant’s bedroom and claimed that he was taking vaseline from the wardrobe. He said when Ms Jobane found her money missing, she suspected Gwetese because he had seen the bag containing the money in her wardrobe during the time he was taking some Vaseline from her bedroom. “Ms Jobane was not at home when her money was stolen and when she came back she realised her money was missing. She only suspected Gwetese’s because he had spare keys to her house,” said Mr Dlodlo. Ms Jobane reported the matter to the police and investigations led to Gwetese’s arrest. 500 rand was recovered from Gwetese. @LissahMangena
