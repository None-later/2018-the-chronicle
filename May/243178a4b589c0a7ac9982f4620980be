Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Bulawayo baseball team is confident of bringing home gold from the Baseball Championship Series that begins at Allan Wilson High School in Harare today. The tournament will feature three provinces including hosts Harare Metropolitan and Manicaland Metropolitan province who will be making their debut appearance in the series. Bulawayo baseball team liason officer Eldon Mudzingwa expressed  confidence going into the two day baseball fiesta. “It’s going to be a tough tournament, but we are confident of doing well. Harare have been a dominant force in previous competitions, but we are hoping to end their reign. Everyone has been in high spirits from the day we started training, which is a positive thing heading into such a tournament,” he said. “We did well in the previous edition, but this time around we are aiming for the big prize and are going into the competition going for nothing short of the title. We are trying to give our players more game time and give national team coaches a wide player base to select teams for future international assignments. Our team hopes to fair well in this first tournament of the year. We hope to bring back baseball glory days to our province. This is work in progress and we hope to achieve our set targets for the year,” said Mudzingwa. Bulawayo based Japanese coach Naoki Taniyama will take charge of the team for this series. The hosts will pin their hopes of a series victory on the likes of national team players Shepherd Sibanda, Hloniphani Ngulube and Brandon Majobo.
