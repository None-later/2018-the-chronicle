Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter THE Environment Management Agency (EMA) has warned food outlets in Bulawayo to stop using kaylites as law breakers risk prosecution. EMA has said it is concerned that people are being spotted carrying kaylites around the city centre following a ban on kaylites that was effected last July. Bulawayo Provincial Environmental Manager, Mr Decent Ndlovu said those found to be still using kaylites will be prosecuted. “We are reliably informed that some food outlets in Bulawayo, particularly backyard restaurants have since resumed using kaylites. EMA is appealing to members of the public to contact its offices when they come across food outlets still using kaylites,” he said. Mr Ndlovu said the ban was effected in the interest of public health and businesses found using the banned material risk being fined up to $5 000 or being jailed for a year. “We activated statutory instrument 84 of 2002 which bans the use of kaylites and this is meant to protect the people. Kaylites get heated during food packaging and as a result some gas from the container is mixed with food and this gas causes cancer,” he said. Mr Ndlovu said the use of kaylites also pollutes the environment. Meanwhile, EMA has also warned the privately- run Herentals Group of Colleges against littering the city with its fliers advertising its educational programmes. Mr Ndlovu said the college was last year convicted and fined $500 by the courts for the same crime. “Last week the college was at it again littering literally the whole city including western suburbs with its fliers,” he said. Bulawayo City Council’s Senior Public Relations Officer, Mrs Nesisa Mpofu said they were also aware of the littering problem caused by Herentals College. “The City of Bulawayo has fined Herentals College several times and has also engaged the college but the problem persists,” she said. The college authorities could not be reached for comment. @winnie_masara
