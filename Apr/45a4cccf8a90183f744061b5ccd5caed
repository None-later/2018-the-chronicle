Zifa Matabeleland South chairman Nkosilathi Ncube encouraged teams to adhere to the Zifa rules and regulations. “We are happy to have this league. The goal is to make sure that we have a vibrant league that will produce top players in the country. Hopefully, with time we will have topflight football coming to Gwanda. “It was agreed that the teams will register 40 players each for a fee of $1.50 per player and five technical team members for a fee of $5 each. “The high number of players is to give the youth a chance to pursue their talent. The players’ ages must range from 18-35 years, though the emphasis is on the youth because they are the future. “Each team should have a committee that will present to us their constitution and that committee will have to familiarise with the rules and regulations of the league to be provided by Zifa,” said Ncube.
