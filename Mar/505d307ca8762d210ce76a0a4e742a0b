 Sikhumbuzo Moyo in Tsholotsho THERE was a controversial end to the Matabeleland North National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) inter-district track and field athletics meet when Bubi’s Under-20 boys 4x100m relay team was adjudged to have come second to Hwange’s Dickson Kapandura inspired team who are said to have won by a torso finish. Kapandura’s team clocked 44.43 seconds while Bubi team clocked 44.56 seconds. Soon after the end of the race the Bubi district team erupted in jubilation with their head in charge of athletics Cain Ncube running straight to the field to congratulate his boys for finally putting an end to the Hwange team’s dominance but received the shock of his life upon being informed later that his boys actually won silver. “It can’t be, we don’t understand how because our boy was just ahead of the Hwange athlete,” said Ncube in total anger and surprise. The controversial last event victory by Hwange saw them taking their final gold figure to 21 and came second to Binga who managed to retain their title with a gold medal haul of 23. The winners had nine silver and 12 bronze medals while Hwange got 13 silver and 19 bronze medals for their second place finish. Aggrieved Bubi came out sixth with 10 gold medals, 16 silver and 12 bronze medals while anchoring the final medal table was Nkayi who had eight gold, 13 silver and 18 bronze medals. Besides the controversial end to the two day event, the competition was a marvel for the spectators as the province’s seven districts toiled it out to choose the provincial team for the national finals which are set for White City Stadium in Bulawayo next week. The selected squad is expected to go into camp any time next week to fine tune the athletes ahead of the national finals.
