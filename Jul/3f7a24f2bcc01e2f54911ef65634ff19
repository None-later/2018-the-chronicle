 Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter POLICE in Matabeleland South are appealing to anyone who may have information that can lead to the arrest of thieves who stole copper cables worth more than $28 000 in two different areas in Esigodini. Matabeleland South police spokesperson Inspector Philisani Ndebele said Zesa officials discovered the theft at midnight on Tuesday. He said no arrests have been made so far. “ At Blue Ridge Farm, cables worth $28 125 were taken while about $4 210 worth of cables were taken near Sacred Heart Primary School and found dumped in the bush. We suspect the thieves may have dumped the recovered cables after they were disturbed,” he said. Insp Ndebele said theft of copper cables has become rampant crippling operations at many institutions such as hospitals, schools and business. “We appeal to members of the public with information that could lead to the arrest of the culprits to approach any police station near them. It is important for these culprits to be arrested as they are causing so much unnecessary disruptions within the province and posing a threat to the nation’s economic growth,” he said. In May, two men were sentenced to 20 years in jail for stealing Zesa cables worth $1 925 from a power line in Figtree. The pair was caught by security guards after cutting Zesa cables at Cyrene Mission.—@winnie_masara
