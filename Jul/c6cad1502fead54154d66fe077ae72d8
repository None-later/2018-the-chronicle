Mr Kofi Annan Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent FORMER United Nations Secretary General Mr Kofi Annan and chairman of The Elders, among other diplomats, is set for a three-day visit to Zimbabwe where they will meet political parties and other interested players ahead of the harmonised polls. The country will hold harmonised elections at the end of this month on July 30. The Elders is an “independent group of global leaders working together for peace and human rights.” Its members include South Africa’s Reverend Desmond Tutu and late South Africa’s former President Nelson Mandela’s wife Ms Graça Machel. In a statement yesterday, Elders head of communications Mr William French said Mr Annan will land in the country on Thursday. “The Elders, with the support of the Kofi Annan Foundation, will visit Zimbabwe from 19 to 21 July to meet political leaders and support all actors working for free, fair and transparent elections, an inclusive transition and a brighter future for the country,” said Mr French. “(Mr) Annan, chair of The Elders and the Kofi Annan Foundation and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, will lead the delegation. He will be joined by Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and United Nation High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, former Foreign Minister of Algeria and UN diplomat.” Mr French said: “The delegation expects to meet political leaders, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec), the diplomatic community, civil society representatives and media.” Zec has accredited more than 800 local and international observers to assess the country’s polls. President Mnangagwa’s Government has said it will invite all interested international observers as it has nothing to hide. @nqotshili
