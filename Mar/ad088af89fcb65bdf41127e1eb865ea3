Midlands Minister of State, Cde Owen Ncube who was the guest speaker at the function implored sports associations to build strong brands which will attract sponsorship from the corporate world. “It’s time that sports persons, especially those who are in football which is a popular sport, build strong brands that attract sponsorship from the corporate world. Sponsors want value for their money hence the need to build these strong brands which assist sponsors to market their products,” said the provincial minister. The medical service provider principal officer, Patience Kunyangwe said the sponsorship was a way of giving back to the community and at the same time unlocking the potential of their brand through sport. Zifa Central Region Soccer League chairman, Stanley Chapeta, said the sponsorship package will make the league more competitive. The Division One League which has since been branded the Zimbabwe General Medical Aid Fund Central Region Soccer League (ZGMAF-CSL) is set to roar into life on Saturday. — @lavuzigara1
