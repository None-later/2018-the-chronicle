 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter SEVEN teams are set to battle it out in the Bulawayo Volleyball Association (BVA) pre-season tournament slated for Milton High School this afternoon.

Milton High, Luveve High, Nust, Bulawayo Polytechnic, ZRP Raiders, Spartans and Hurricanes are expected to square off in the traditional season opener. Teams are expected to provide men and women teams. BVA chairperson, William Mazviro said all was set for the volleyball fiesta. “Preparations for the tournament are at an advance stage and we expect to see some competitive action. The tournament will allow teams to prepare for their upcoming volleyball events,” he said. Speaking on the upcoming season Mazviro said: “Preparations for the new season are on and we hope to have an exciting season. We are excited by the possibility of having new teams in our league such as Lupane State University, National University of Science and Technology and Bulawayo Polytechnic. The more teams we have in the league, the more we move towards our goal to further spread the sport in the city and we hope to achieve all this during the course of this season. Hurricanes, Unit Fair Bridge, Spartans, ZRP Raiders and Luveve High are the teams that took part in the league season last season. The BVA league will use White City Stadium courts, Milton High School and Khanyisile Sports Centre as venues for league action this season. The association is optimistic they can spark renewed interest in volleyball in the city this season. — @innocentskizoe
