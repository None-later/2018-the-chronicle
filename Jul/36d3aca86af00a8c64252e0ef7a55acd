 Collin Matiza, Harare Bureau FOUR of Zimbabwe’s top junior and senior motocross riders are expected to fly the country’s flag high when they compete in Round Four of the 2018 South African National Championship series at Terra Topia Dirk Bike Club just outside Johannesburg on Saturday. The riders are Emmanuel Bako, Regan Wasmuth, Ashley Thixton and Jayden Ashwell. Round Four of this year’s South African Nationals, just like the opening three rounds of this tough seven-round series, is once again heavily subscribed as a big field of more than 120 riders, drawn from across South Africa and Zimbabwe, had entered to compete in this event ahead of the close of the pre-entries at 6:30pm yesterday. And among the more than 100 riders who had already forwarded their names for this one-day event were four of Zimbabwe’s top junior and senior bikers Bako, Wasmuth, Thixton and Ashwell who are all expected to be fighting for the top honours in the different classes that they will be competing in at Terra Topia on Saturday. Bako (12) will be fighting on two fronts on Saturday as he will be competing in the 65cc and 85cc (Juniors) classes while Wasmuth (17), Thixton and Ashwell will be the country’s flagbearers in the 125cc High School, MX2 and MX1 senior classes respectively. And all eyes in the Zimbabwean camp will be on Bako and Wasmuth who are both in a strong running for the 65cc and 125cc High School titles in this year’s South African National Championship series after they put up some strong performances in their respective classes during the opening three rounds of this competition which got underway on February 17.
