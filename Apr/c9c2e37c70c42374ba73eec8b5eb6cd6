Other than that, preparations are going on well,” said Zanele Ncube, one of the organisers. She said voting for the People’s Choice Award and Miss Personality was underway. “People can log onto our Miss Nust Facebook page. There are pictures of all the finalists and they are free to vote for their favourite. “The one who’ll get many likes automatically becomes the People’s Choice. The deadline for voting is on Saturday, just before the event kicks off.” Miss Nust has grown to become one of the most popular pageants in Bulawayo especially considering that the city’s flagship pageant – Miss Bulawayo is no longer being held. The pageant has also produced quality models like Ashley Morgen who have gone on to compete at national pageants and excelled. Morgen is the reigning Miss Tourism Zimbabwe.
