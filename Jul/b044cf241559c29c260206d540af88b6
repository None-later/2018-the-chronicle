Descent Dube, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO deputy provincial education director Mathias Luphahla yesterday launched the Bulawayo Provincial Annual Science, Sports and Arts Festival (PASSAF) at Milton High School. PASSAF includes art and sport not covered by the National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash), such as gymnastics, karate, ICT games, dance, poetry, painting, craft, home décor and mass displays, among others. The festival will be held at Milton High from today up to Friday. Luphahla said the event will see learners from ECD to A-Level working together to showcase what they have learnt in the new curriculum. “It is our duty to identify talent and make sure every child has something to take home. We intend to ensure that the curriculum is fully implemented by producing innovative and resourceful pupils,” said Luphahla. “What they (students) do in sports must demonstrate that at the end of the day some are going to be successful athletes and earn a living through sport and art.” PASSAF chairperson Getrude Ndlovu said gone are the days of looking at how many subjects a student has passed, as learners can now acquire appropriate knowledge, skills and values in the field of sport and art. “We catch them young and we’re not only building Zimbabwe as a nation, but building the world. Our theme is to celebrate the joy of a competence-based environment through talent identification,” Ndlovu said. Bulawayo will also host the National Annual Science, Sport and Art Festival in September and Luphahla said the province is confident that this year’s event will be better than in 2017. — @DecoDecent2.
