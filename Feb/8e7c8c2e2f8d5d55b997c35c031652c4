Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter INYATHI High School narrowly defended their Bubi district National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) inter-schools track and field athletics championship held at Siganda Secondary School on Thursday and Friday last week. Inyathi were propelled by their two outstanding athletes Alex Muringa and Aaron Chapwanya to haul 35 gold, eight silver and nine bronze medals. Somvubu were second with 32 gold, 32 silver and 29 bronze medals, while third place went to Majiji, who won 14 gold, 2 silver and 27 bronze medals. “It was a well run competition, which was part of our selection process for the district team that will represent us at the provincial meet in Tsholotsho next month and to this end, the selected athletes will camp at Somvubu High from March 2 until departure for the provincial finals,” said the district head-in-charge of athletics Cain Ncube, the headmaster of Sijahugwe Secondary School. “We are grateful that the heavens allowed us to hold our two-day event because had it rained, we might have had challenges and failed to finish all our events,” said Ncube. Host school Siganda were fourth with nine gold, 15 silver and 21 bronze medals. Nash district chairperson Khumbulani Sibanda called for a preparatory meeting of school heads today to come up with a training programme for the athletes. The district team was selected by Munyaradzi Moyo and Prince Ndebele, a holder of an international athletics coaching qualification.
