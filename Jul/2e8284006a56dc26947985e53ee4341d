Sam Dzvimbu Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter SPORTS and Recreation Commission (SRC) Bulawayo Province successfully hosted a Level One Sports Medicine workshop held at United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) Richard Morris Nurses Home at the weekend. The two-day workshop saw over 30 participants take part in the course aimed at equipping sports practitioners with the latest trends in sports injury prevention, care and management. The course was conducted by Dr Tongai Mukwewa from the Zimbabwe Sports Medicine Association. The workshop covered topics such as how to detect and assess injuries, prevention and referral system. “Lectures were based on common sports injuries that they are going to encounter in their different sporting discipline. We also introduced special topics like sports nutrition, diet, psychology and basic life support which is very critical. The participants were very excited to learn and their response was very impressive,” said Dr Mukwewa. Sports and Recreation Commission’s Provincial Sport Coordinator Sam Dzvimbu said: “This has been a very successful course, we are happy with the turn out and we believe this is a step in the right direction for sport in the country. Sport is now highly scientific and we noted that we needed to move with the latest trends in Sports Medicine and our hope is that this will help our coaches to assist players to prevent potential injuries and in the event that they occur they know how to care for them.” The workshop is part of the educational drive that the province has embarked on as it implements its 2018 action plan and some of the courses that will be offered during the course of year include Sports Administration, Event Management and Community Sport Leader Course.
