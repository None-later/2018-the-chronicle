We only had cabbage or beans. At times we were made to sleep as early as 4PM and the sleeping conditions are unbearable,” said Mutungamiri Mutungamiri pleaded guilty to domestic violence charges when he appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Lungile Ncube yesterday. The magistrate fined him $100 or 90 days in prison.
