Showbiz Correspondent In a bid of rehabilitate and reintegrate prisoners into society, a talent show Inside-Out has been organised for them and will be held at the Bulawayo prisons as from tomorrow. The talent show that will be launched at Khami Maximum prison tomorrow will be held at Bulawayo Prison on Monday, then at Mlondolozi Special Institute and Khami Medium on Tuesday before it goes to Khami Remand on Wednesday. Inside Out is being organised by Clarence “Kirah” Garura who is the Zimbabwe Prison and Correctional Services Arts and Rehab Ambassador for Bulawayo Metropolitan province. He said for prisoners, practising the arts was one of the best forms of rehabilitation. “Arts is like medicine to them as it helps them to deal positively with denial and accept their fate. After realising that inmates need motivation, I decided to host this talent show to help rehabilitate and prepare them for reintegration back to communities after they finish serving their jail terms,” said Kirah. “Arts in prisons enable us to view rehabilitation not as a strategy, but a holistic phenomenon incorporating and encouraging inmates to be better people and masters of their own destinies when they finish serving their jail terms. It also prepares them for reintegration back to the community.” “We hope that with this talent show, inmates can learn self-sustainability so as to increase their chances of successfully reintegrating.”
