Twitter Response to “A journey well completed.” Words of a true leader. ED deserves to be our president. – @Tichaona. Response to “Chamisa election petition latest.” Chamisa is delaying the inevitable. He has no chance of winning, why can’t he see that? – @Makanaka Response to “Devolution a priority: President.” ED is building a new, better Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe has no other choice but to prosper. – @Danielkaizer. Response to “Bad boy Denver dazzles.” He is proving to be another Archford Chimutanda…brilliant when available and when he chooses to be. – @lotchitakasha. Website Response to “Chamisa election petition latest.” The MDC Alliance leadership lost the elections because of their support for Zidera. Frivolous legal gymnastics will not assist those who support sanctions to govern this great nation. – Cde Mzvinavhu. Response to “(Under the eaves with Igomombe) Zimbabwe: Fighting over our mother’s breast.” The outcome of the election shows that the majority still support President Mnangagwa and Zanu-PF regardless of heavy MDC propaganda. The revolution happened 40 years ago. Now there is only one way: evolution. – Cucumba SMS/WHATSAPP The idea by Harare to clamp down on noise-makers is good and long overdue. A by-law on noise pollution should be put in place especially to regulate noise by bars and churches, at night. I think South Africa has one. Although there is freedom of worship, it is unbearable for those who stay close to churches when they have all night prayers. – Sharon Lee Maposa.
