 Sylvester Chiramba, Court Reporter A MAN from Bulawayo allegedly defrauded seven people of $60 after promising to secure them jobs at the revived National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ). Wilson Banda (63) from Old Lobengula suburb reportedly lied that he would secure employment for Sithembile Mhlanga, Lindiwe Mlilo, Duduzile Gumbo, Alexandra Siamundanda, Justice Ndlovu, Adon Dhurara and Shelton Gumbo at NRZ since the company had received new equipment and was looking to hire more manpower. Banda allegedly ordered his victims to pay a fee for the registration process to the national employment council and promised he would give them Zanu-PF membership cards saying they were the only requirement needed for securing the jobs. He appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Lungile Ncube charged with seven counts of fraud. Banda was not asked to plead and was remanded out of custody to today for plea recording. Prosecuting, Mr Petros Shoko told the court that on February 17 Banda approached the seven complainants on separate occasions and misrepresented to then that he was close to a well-placed employee of the NRZ. “He promised to secure employment for the seven complainants since Government had secured new locomotives saying the NRZ was in need of more manpower,” said Mr Shoko. “Banda would ask the complainants for a sum of money, which he said would be used to register them at the national employment council and give them Zanu-PF membership cards in return, which he said were the only requirements needed to be employed by NRZ.” Mr Shoko said Mr Gumbo grew suspicious after Banda had given him the Zanu-PF membership card but could not give him satisfactory answers as to when he would secure the job. The matter was reported to the police leading to Banda’s arrest. @SlyCee10
