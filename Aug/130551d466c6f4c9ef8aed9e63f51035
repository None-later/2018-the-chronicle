 Descent Dube, Sports Reporter ACTING Nash president Arthur Maphosa is happy with the facilities at Eveline and Northlea High Schools to be used by the Confederations of School Sport Association of Southern Africa (Cossasa) teams that went into camp yesterday. Team Zimbabwe will be using the facilities to prepare for the Cossasa games ahead of departure for Namibia on Monday. “I’m happy with the preparations and the facilities at both venues.  The courts and accommodation for our teams are up to standard. The atmosphere is jovial and the teams are raring to go,” said Maphosa. He  said it was unfortunate that they had to leave out some of the disciplines due to financial challenges. “We wanted to take everyone who qualified to Namibia but our financial status limited us,” said Maphosa, a headmaster at Gwanda High School in Matabeleland South province. @DecoDecent2
