 Midlands Bureau Chief REDCLIFF Municipality has struck a $15 million deal with a Hungarian investor that will see the rehabilitation of the water treatment plant to improve water services. Redcliff Mayor, Councillor Freddy Kapuya, said they have managed to negotiate with Hungarians a deal that will see them draw piped water at very low rates from the nearby Cactus Poorte Dam, which is 3km away from the town. He said the deal would solve the perennial water challenges bedevilling the local authority since the demise of Ziscosteel about 10 years ago. “We struck a $15 million deal with a Hungarian investor for the resuscitation of a water treatment plant at Cactus Poorte Dam as we seek a permanent solution to the water woes we face year in and out,” said Clr Kapuya. “The water body is not sufficient to supply the town and its industries all year round but with a bit of rationing the city can enjoy supplies for 365 days.” Redcliff draws its water from the City of Kwekwe but the past few years have seen its water challenges escalating as the latter disconnected supplies due to a ballooning debt now hovering above $2 million. Meanwhile, Clr Kapuya said at least 2 000 former Ziscosteel employees owed the municipality more than $2 million in unpaid rates. He said his council has resolved to engage the former workers who are still grappling to settle their arrears as casual workers as a means of offsetting their debts to the local authority. “To help recoup some of the losses, the local authority has since engaged the residents who owe us money as casual workers so they can offset their unpaid bills. The work will involve clearing roadsides, blocked drainage pipes and collecting refuse while skilled ones repair street lights and water works for $10 a day, which goes towards offsetting their debt to council,” said Clr Kapuya. He said a majority of residents were elderly women who are eager to provide their labour to council to avoid being evicted from the houses.
