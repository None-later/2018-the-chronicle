The late Roger Russell Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE late former Zimbabwe Saints fitness trainer, Roger Russell, was yesterday described as a disciplined and passionate football lover. Russell (57), died at Mater Dei Hospital in Bulawayo on Sunday morning, barely a few hours after being admitted after complaining of a sore arm. He was buried at West Park Cemetery yesterday. In his graveside eulogy, Zifa vice-president Omega Sibanda told mourners that Russell was a peacemaker who always preached the gospel of peace and reconciliation. “It is football that has been robbed by the death of this man. He had passion for the game, enjoyed it so much and always listened to advice,” said Sibanda. He said he was humbled by the huge turnout to bid farewell to Russell, an accomplished businessman and well known personality in Bulawayo. Thousands of mourners attended the burial service, which included a large pool of former Zimbabwe Saints executives as well as former players such as Agent Sawu, Shakey Nyathi, Aubrey Sauramba and yesteryear Highlanders’ stars Tobias Mudyambanje and Amini Soma-Phiri. Former Hwange treasurer and chairman, Lovemore Sibanda, was also among the mourners who bade farewell to a man many described as a gentle giant. Russell is survived by wife Norah and two daughters Mellisa and Laura. His death came barely a few days after he celebrated his 33rd wedding anniversary. @skhumoyo2000
