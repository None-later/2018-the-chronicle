Omega Sibanda Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIFA vice-president Omega Sibanda won the right to represent the ruling Zanu-PF party in the impending harmonised elections after defeating incumbent MP Josphat Madubeko in the Vungu constituency. Sibanda will not be the first football administrator to hold political office, as Caf president Ahmad, a Malagasy national, was chairman of the Madagascar Football Association and a Senator for the ruling party as well as Minister of Fisheries. Across the Limpopo, Safa president Danny Jordan was also mayor of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Council on an ANC ticket. In Uganda, the Federation of Uganda Football Associations vice-president Florence Nakiwala Kiyingi is also the Minister of Youth and Children Affairs as well as chairperson of Uganda Premier League side Express FC. “Fifa is very clear on football and politics; it says don’t bring politics into football and vice versa. You can’t be seen putting on political regalia at a football function or clad in football regalia during a political event. In short, football and politics are like oil and water; they don’t mix, but need each other,” said an observer.
