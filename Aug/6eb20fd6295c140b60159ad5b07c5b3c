Response to “World congratulates ED, Zim”. — The world came and the world monitored our elections and now the world has spoken. It’s time to move on as a country, burying our unbridled egos for the sake of Zimbabwe. — Gilbert Bere Response to “Chamisa clutching at straws.” — Chamisa must just grow up. The poor get food stamps and farmers receive state subsidies in the USA. It’s also undeniable that US illegal sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe at the instigation of the unpatriotic and opportunistic MDC decimated our economy and tilted the field in favour of the MDC and that’s why jobless and suffering urban residents voted overwhelmingly for Chamisa. — Tinoziwa. Response to “Tentative date set for inauguration”. — We are moving forward and we don’t have time for those who are clinging on to the past. Some of us are now waiting for more ground breaking events to be done so that industries are resuscitated. All the best ED, remember you have more than the voting population behind your back! Together Zimbabwe will never be the same again. — Sharon Zimbe.
