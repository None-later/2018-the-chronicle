 Nyaradzo Bakari, Chronicle Reporter A 23-YEAR-OLD man from Bulawayo has appeared in court for allegedly stabbing another man thrice after accusing him of assaulting his younger brother. Shepherd Nyathi from Njube suburb allegedly stabbed Mr Mthabisi Mpofu from the same suburb in his chest with an okapi knife in January this year. The court heard that Mr Mpofu was admitted to Mpilo Central Hospital after the incident. Nyathi was not asked to plead to an attempted murder charge before Western Commonage magistrate Ms Tancy Dube yesterday. Ms Dube remanded him in custody to May 18. She advised Nyathi to apply for bail at the High Court. Prosecuting Ms Margret Takawira said Nyathi assaulted Mr Mpofu before stabbing him thrice in the chest on January 22. “On January 22 at around 6PM, the complainant had a dispute with the accused after he had assaulted the accused’s young brother, Iphithule Hlathi. The accused assaulted the complainant with fists before producing an okapi knife and stabbing the complainant three times in the left side of his chest,” she said. Ms Takawira said Mr Mpofu fell to the ground and was rushed to the hospital where he was admitted for some days. She said a medical report could be used as evidence before the court. @NyarieBakie
