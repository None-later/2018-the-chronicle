 Who said women can’t do it? For a long time, there were professional limitations that society set for women. But Lindiwe Marufu (33) of Glen View 3 has decided to live her life by defying the odds. She is a carpenter at Highglen shopping centre in Budiriro. Marufu specialises in making chairs, wardrobes, cabinets and she is doing well if not better than her male counterparts. Although the carpentry business is male-dominated, she did not let that stop her. In fact it gave her strength to prove her competence in the male-dominated industry. Marufu got the idea to start her own carpentry business while she was working for a carpenter at Glen View area 8 complex. “I registered the idea of starting my own business while I was working for another carpenter at Glen View area 8 complex. “I realised that I was just as gifted as my employer so I decided to venture into my own business and employ others. “I was tired of working for other people. I wanted to be my own boss,’’ said Marufu. Operating with limited resources, Marufu started making small things like tables and small chairs at home. She then moved to Highglen shopping centre as her business started to grow. The young carpenter has five employees, two of them women. Marufu has a strong customer base from as far afield as Bulawayo, Gweru, Mutare and Rusape where she mainly supplies furniture shops with her products. She makes use of social media platforms to market her products and this has proved to be a masterstroke. The young entrepreneur has embraced the use of plastic money to ensure that her business thrives. Her flexible payment methods have put her way ahead of her competitors. Marufu wants to take advantage of opportunities made available by President Mnangagwa’s call for Zimbabweans to take advantage of new business opportunities in the country. Marufu is looking forward to opening a furniture shop in Harare. Samantha Chipoyera
