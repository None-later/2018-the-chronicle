Shadel Noble Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent SHADEL Noble (pictured) is raking in awards as the model recently landed his second Roil Bulawayo Arts Award (RoilBAA) for being the Most Outstanding Male Model in as many years. The former basketball player added to the Mr Zimbabwe title he won last year during the Zimbabwe Model Awards, the Best Male Model of the year gong at the Matabeleland Fashion Week and Zambian Fashion Awards where he bagged the Best International Male model last year. After the RoilBAAs nominees list was released, there was a bit of controversy, as with most awards ceremonies, when photographer Mgcini Nyoni sparked debate saying Shadel was the only one who deserved the accolade in the male model category. To this, Shadel said, he was pleased that someone was noticing that he was working hard.
