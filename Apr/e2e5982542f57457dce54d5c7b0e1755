Sports Reporter SIX teams will compete at the inaugural Thandi Tshili-sponsored six-team tournament to be held at Bhekeni Line, Ntabazinduna on April 7 and 8. Newly formed Bhekeni Celtic who will compete in the Zifa Bulawayo Province Division Three League, Super Eagles, Burning Spears, Flying, Best Football Club and Bulawayo Legends will battle it out at the competition. Thembinkosi Ncube, a member of the tournament’s organising committee as well as Bhekeni Celtic secretary, said the competition is meant to unveil the club to the community of Ntabazinduna. “The idea of this tournament is to parade Bhekeni Celtic to the community. This tournament is more of a launch of our club and we’ve invited teams to come and have an exciting sporting weekend. Bhekeni Celtic has just affiliated with the Bulawayo’s Division Three and what we want is to have a buy-in from the community,” said Ncube. At the weekend Bhekeni Celtic played two friendly games, beating Trumus of Victoria Falls 3-0 on Saturday at the resort town’s Chinotimba Stadium and yesterday emerged 1-0 victorious against Hwange’s Baobab Rovers. Ncube said his club is made up of Ntabazinduna and Bulawayo-based players.
