 Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent A MAN from Gokwe went berserk, axed his mother to death before attacking his sister whom he left for dead. John Chifamba of Village Madanyika, Chief Nemangwe struck his mother Shingirai Chifamba five times with an axe accusing her of causing the misfortune he was encountering in life through witchcraft. He left his sister Sabina battling for life after he struck her once on the head after she tried to restrain him from attacking their mother. Chifamba was not asked to plead to one count of murder and another of attempted murder when he appeared before Gokwe Magistrate Ms Evelyn Mashavakure yesterday. He was remanded in custody to April 29 and advised to apply for bail at the High Court. The State led by Mr Maxwell Tafira alleges that on April 2 this year at around 10AM, Chifamba armed himself with an axe and approached his mother’s homestead where he found her seated outside. “He started shouting at his mother accusing her of being a witch and having caused bad luck in his life,” Mr Tafira told the court. An altercation ensured, the court heard, leading to his sister Sabina trying to restrain the axe-wielding Chifamba from axing their hapless mother. Chifamba instead, turned on Sabina and struck her once on the head, rendering her unconscious. He turned to his mother whom he axed five times and she died on the spot. Neighbours who heard the screams attended the scene and ferried Sabina to Gokwe District Hospital. She was later referred to Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals in Harare where she is battling for life. Chifamba was arrested on the following day after police launched a manhunt.
