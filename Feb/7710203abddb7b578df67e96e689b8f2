Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls THE Zimbabwe Handball Federation, Matabeleland North board in conjunction with the Sport and Recreation Commission has lined up a series of training workshops to develop grassroots sport in the province. Four general handball workshops have been organised for all the seven districts with Binga setting the ball rolling yesterday at Binga High. Newly elected provincial chair Taurai Muberekwa said: “This is the first time we are having such an exercise in Matabeleland North where the level of sport is a bit low.” Certified instructors are conducting the training. “We will be selecting district executives after the workshops because we want people with the same goal and objective. We are targeting teachers and coaches under the National Association of Primary School Heads (Naph) and National Association for Secondary School Heads (Nash) as well as community sports clubs,” said Muberekwa. He said the workshops are also meant to raise awareness among educators and communities that besides academic education, individuals also need to be developed in their various extra-curricular talents and skills. The Hwange and Lupane sessions will be held next Friday. Bubi and Nkayi will be done on February 23 before the last lap for Tsholotsho and Umguza districts. Venues for the workshops are still being worked on. Naph and Nash participants will pay $15 while individuals pay $12 registration fee. When the new 12-member provincial board came into power last month, it vowed to instil a culture of transparency and revitalise the sport at district level. This comes in the wake of dismal performance by Matabeleland North over the years at various national events because of maladministration and lack of grassroots programmes. The board wants in the long run to revive dormant clubs in Binga, Hwange, Lupane and Victoria Falls.— @ncubeleon
