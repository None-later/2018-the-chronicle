 Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau A ZIMBABWEAN man was killed in South Africa when he tried to grab a gun from one of four armed robbery suspects who pounced on a bus he was travelling in. The incident occurred on Wednesday at around 5.45AM along the N1 highway in Modimolle area as 23 Zimbabweans, the deceased included, were travelling from Johannesburg, Gauteng province.
