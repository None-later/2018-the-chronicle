Hwabaraty Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent CONTEMPORARY musician Hwabaraty wants to get up and close with fans by staging an intimate show he has dubbed “An Evening with Hwabaraty”. The event, pencilled for June 29, will be held at the Bulawayo Theatre. In order to boost the event, he has roped in the likes of Skyz Metro FM radio personality and self-proclaimed First Lady of Zimbabwe house music TKP and Babongile Sikhonjwa. Hwabaraty said he had included these two as TKP has a song, Mina Nawe with him while Sikhonjwa – who will be the host – has always supported his cause. He said more artistes will be included and will be revealed at a later stage. After a sterling performance during the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards (RoilBAAs) where Hwabaraty was touted as one of the standout artistes, the musician (real name Japhet Mlauzi), said the show was meant to give followers an opportunity to watch him in action. “I was inspired to do this concert after so many requests of my tracks online. Even the support that I got from people who voted for me at the RoilBAAs warmed my heart. “I might not have won an award, but in the hood, I know a lot of people love me so much so this concert is a dedication to them for being loyal to me,” said Hwabaraty. With two albums to his name, Isilwane and Woza Nhlanhla, the musician said he was going to record the show as he is documenting his musical career. “The show will have a mix of my two albums and I’ll be performing songs that people like from each of them. Also, I’ll record the performance like I did in January. “This is because I want to document my music career and send it to people in the diaspora so they also have a feel of my live performance.” Entrance to the show has been pegged at $5.
