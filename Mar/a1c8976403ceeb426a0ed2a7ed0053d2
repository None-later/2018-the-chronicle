 From Tobias Mandoreba in Hwange THE soccer-mad safari town of Dete will over the Easter Holidays play host to the Anti-Poaching Wafa Wafa Soccer Challenge featuring teams from that area’s Zifa Matabeleland North Division Three (Iganyana) League. According to Ashley Ndebele, the spokesperson for the sponsors, who comprise New Game Reserve Hotel, Becks Safari Guiding School and Painted Dog Conservation, the tournament will serve as a precursor to the onset of the 2018 Iganyana League. The tournament is also meant to educate the community against poaching in this conservation and wildlife rich area. “Yes, we are hosting a unique football tournament for the teams in our league to help them prepare for a new season but at the same time we also hope to spread the anti-poaching message through sport. Dete is the ceremonial home of conservation and wildlife with places like Main Camp and many safari companies dotted around. The games will start on Good Friday with teams divided into four groups with the semi finals and  the final set for the Zimparks Main Camp ground on Sunday where leading Zimdancehall artiste Shinsoman will be our guest and will present prizes together with Zimparks senior officials.” said Ndebele. Group A will feature Rock Rabbits FC, Bushbucks FC, Foxes and Tigers(Gwayi venue) while Group B will have Eagles, Shumba Juniors, Black Leopards and Chapungu slugging it out in Lupote. At Chezhou ground, the tussle will be between Elands FC, Cheetahs, Rhinos and Zebras. Group D will be a battle between Sables, Iwisa Juniors, Maganyana and Buffaloes at ZRP Dete ground. The tournament’s winners will have their 2018 affiliation fees, player and coaches’ licence and referees’ fees for all home matches paid in full by the sponsors. There will also be entertainment galore at the end of the tournament with Shinsoman performing at New Game Reserve Hotel in the evening on Easter Sunday. — @tobymandox
