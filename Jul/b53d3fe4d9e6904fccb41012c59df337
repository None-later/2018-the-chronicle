VP Chiwenga Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls ACTING President Dr Constantino Chiwenga says there is great optimism for Zimbabwe’s economy under the new political administration, which has revitalised business growth. Dr Chiwenga was speaking during the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC) awards ceremony here on Thursday. He said Government will continue to come up with policies that support industrial development. “There is a great sense of optimism in the country as we see green shoots of economic recovery in this new phase of growth and opportunity. Some of the policies that the new dispensation has put in place are already bearing fruit. Businesses are at the heart of our economic transformation and as Government, we will strive to provide a conducive environment,” said Dr Chiwenga. He challenged businesses to embrace innovation and be creative to play a role in taking the country forward towards the 2030 vision. Dr Chiwenga said Government appreciates the role business continues to play in the economy and employment creation. “Let me reiterate that the mantra ‘Zimbabwe is open for business’ is a clarion call for putting in place a business environment that attracts both local and foreign investment,” he said. “Government commends ZNCC for continuing to work with business in identifying future growth clusters and developing economic strategies to position Zimbabwe among the leading economic powerhouses in the region and internationally.” Dr Chiwenga said Zimbabwean businesses need to excel by producing quality products and services as the country gears itself to participate in the global village. He said PPPs and corporate social responsibility by companies have augmented Government efforts in infrastructure development. Government, said Dr Chiwenga, has embarked on a plan to privatise parastatals and state owned entities after a realisation of their limited role in direct investment. The ZNCC congress started on Wednesday and ended on Friday. @ncubeleon
