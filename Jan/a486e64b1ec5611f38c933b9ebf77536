Bongani Mafu Allan Foti, Sports Correspondent FORMER Highlanders head coach Bongani Mafu got off to a winning start with his new employers Orapa United when they edged his former paymasters Mochudi Centre Chiefs 1-0. Mafu’s charges gave him something to smile about in his first competitive game in charge of Orapa when a first half strike by Gift Moyo gave him maximum points in a Botswana Premier League match on Saturday. The win moved Orapa to 22 points and fourth place on the league table, 11 points behind table toppers Township Rollers. Speaking from Botswana yesterday, Mafu said the match was played in very hot conditions, which denied both clubs the opportunity to flourish. He said his side was fitter and this was the difference. “I played my first match in charge of Orapa last weekend and we managed to beat Mochudi Centre Chiefs 1-0 thanks to a goal by attacking linkman Gift Moyo in the first half. It was a very difficult match to get a grip on because we played under very hot conditions. I was fortunate to find a fit squad and that’s why we managed to get three points,” Mafu said. He said both teams exhibited flashes of good football, but not enough to make the entire encounter exciting for the fans. Mafu said he would be making at least two additions to the squad he inherited from newly appointed Highlanders’ coach Madinda Ndlovu. @AllanFoti
