 Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter THE National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) passenger train between Bulawayo and Victoria Falls was on Tuesday delayed for about 10 hours after a goods train derailed and blocked the railway line in Hwange. NRZ spokesperson Mr Nyasha Maravanyika said there were no injuries following the derailment. He said the accident occurred at 7AM on Tuesday and by 5pm yesterday the NRZ technicians had cleared the railway line. “It was a normal derailment where two axels were off the rail and our technicians are investigating the cause of the accident,” said Mr Maravanyika. He said normal services resumed soon after the clearing of the railway line. Mr Maravanyika said the locomotive that derailed belongs to Beitbridge-Bulawayo Railway company and was pulling empty wagons belonging to NRZ towards Bulawayo. @ncubeleon
