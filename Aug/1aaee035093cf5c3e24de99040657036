Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau SOUTH Africa’s specialised crime busting unit, the Hawks on Tuesday evening intercepted a stolen Toyota Fortuner worth thousands of dollars which was destined for Malawi via Zimbabwe. Hawks spokesperson for Limpopo Province Captain Matimba Maluleke said they arrested three suspects aged between 26 and 39 years in connection with the matter. He said the three were intercepted at a toll gate along the N1 highway near Baobab Tollgate in Makhado area. “The intelligence driven operation between the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation Unit, CIG and POPS resulted in the arrest of three suspects aged between 29 and 39 along N1 road near Baobab Tollgate in Makhado area on Tuesday 14 August 2018 for possession of suspected stolen vehicle,” said Capt Maluleke. “The members received intelligence about a stolen Toyota Fortuner that was en-route from Gauteng to Malawi. The vehicle was spotted, stopped, tested and it was found to have been reportedly stolen in Gauteng. The suspects were arrested for possession of suspected stolen vehicle and they are expected to appear at the Makhado Magistrate’s Court tomorrow.” Captian Maluleke said further investigations were in progress.  The smuggling of cars between Zimbabwe and South Africa is rampant. In the last six months the neighbouring country’s security agents recovered more than 20 stolen vehicles along the boundary line. The Chronicle is reliably informed that the cars are destined for Tanzania and Malawi, while others find their way into the local market. In 2012, Zimbabwean police smashed a well-orchestrated car smuggling syndicate near the Panda Mine area and arrested seven Malawians.
