 Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent THE Civil Protection Unit (CPU) has said 57 people have drowned countrywide since October last year. CPU director Mr Nathan Nkomo yesterday said four of the people drowned in Seke, near Chitungwiza last Friday and the bodies are yet to be retrieved. Mr Nkomo said in areas such as Tsholotsho, some huts were now giving in due to excessive rains. “Areas around Tsholotsho where people use mud for the construction of their houses, of late we have lost quite a number of houses there. Some areas in Mashonaland East have also been affected,” he said. Mr Nkomo said due to heavy rains, the CPU was last week forced to engage the Air Force of Zimbabwe to rescue 84 pupils who were marooned following heavy rains in Mt Darwin in Mashonaland Central province. “We averted another near catastrophe in Mount Darwin where a school was built in between two big rivers. We had to ask the Air Force of Zimbabwe to rescue 84 children. Our main worry was that parents would have been tempted to cross flooded rivers and in the process we were going to lose many lives. We could have lost lives of children or parents,” he said. The CPU director said the unit was worried that members of the public were not heeding the department’s warnings not to cross flooded rivers. Mr Nkomo said if necessary, parents should accompany their children to school to avoid unnecessary loss of lives. He said municipalities should also clear storm drains as they were contributing to flooding. “School children, motorists and even vehicles must not cross fast flowing streams or flooded rivers or even flooded storm drains. Drowning is no longer a preserve of rural areas. “Even in towns, local authorities must also play their part. They must clear all the storm drains to avert flash floods,” Mr Nkomo said. @nqotshili
