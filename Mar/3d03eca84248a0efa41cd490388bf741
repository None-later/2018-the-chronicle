Dr Qhubani Moyo Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent THE Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) has registered 10 000 more people at its district centres following the closure of the mobile Biometric Voter Registration (BVR) mop up exercise last month. When it closed its mobile voter registration programme, Zec had registered 5,3 million voters. In an interview, Zec Commissioner Dr Qhubani Moyo said an additional 10 000 people have registered since the end of the mop up exercise on February 8. Dr Moyo urged members of the public who have not registered to vote to do so as the process is still ongoing. “We are still encouraging those who have not registered to go to our district offices and register because the registration is still on,” said Dr Moyo. He said Zec was encouraged by the additional figures which show that people are aware that registration has not been closed but what has been closed is just the mobile registration. “We are very happy with the number. 10 000 is a very significant figure and it confirms that people are aware that registration is continuing. People should continue registering until 12 days after the proclamation of the election date,” he said. Last week, Zec released a provisional electoral roadmap stating that in terms of the Constitution, President Emmerson Mnangagwa is expected to proclaim an election date between April 28 and June 1. It said elections should be held between July 21 and August 21. President Mnangagwa has denounced political violence saying this year’s polls should be free,  fair and credible in order to reflect the will of the people.— @nqotshili
