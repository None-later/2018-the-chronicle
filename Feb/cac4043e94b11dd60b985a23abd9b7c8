Deputy Minister Davis Marapira Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief LANDS, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement Deputy Minister Cde Davis Marapira has said Government remains optimistic that the nation will realise a good harvest following the rains that have been falling countrywide over the past few weeks. He said despite the prolonged dry spell experienced last month, the country has since the beginning of February been receiving some rains. Cde Marapira urged farmers whose crops were a write off after the country endured the prolonged dry spell to take to the fields and plant small grains. “We urge farmers to continue planting summer crops as the rains continue to fall across the country. Some should adjust to short term varieties such as the two and three maize series and small grains such as sorghum. This is also the right time to plant beans and we will be assured of a better harvest,” he             said. Cde Marapira said rainfall experts predicted that there would be rains up to April or May, hence crops planted at this time can potentially do well. “The current rainy season is likely going to go into April or May meaning that moisture in the ground can feed the crops till they mature,” said Cde Marapira. “We know that some crops are leaching but farmers should not worry because Government will give them top dressing fertiliser. But that doesn’t mean that they have to depend on Government 110percent. No. They should also take initiatives like buying fertiliser for their crops so that they benefit by having a better harvest and when they benefit, the country benefits also.”
