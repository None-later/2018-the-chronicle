It’s a beautiful place and our own little secret,” she said amid laughter. The story of the lovebirds has caught global media attention and they are trending on many online news platforms. The Chronicle has received interesting feedback from readers who have been following the story and were commending the couple for defying the predicaments and obstacles by proceeding with their wedding as planned.

She was airlifted to a hospital in Victoria Falls before being transferred to Mater Dei hospital. Her right arm had to be amputated due to the horrific injury she sustained. “Everything is almost sorted and we are going home very soon. Our love story is amazing and I knew she was the one way before I even proposed to her. I’m a happy man,” said Mr Fox. @andile_tshuma
