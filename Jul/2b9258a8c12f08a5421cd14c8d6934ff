Sukoluhle Ndlovu in Gweru THREE-TIME Commonwealth boxing champion winner Langton “Schoolboy” Tinago has been declared a provincial hero and will be buried at the Midlands Provincial Heroes’ acre tomorrow. Langton “Schoolboy” Tinago Tinago succumbed to pneumonia on Tuesday morning. He was 68. Addressing mourners in Mambo, Gweru, yesterday, Midlands Provincial Affairs Minister Owen Ncube said President Emmerson Mnangagwa had conferred provincial hero status on Tinago. “With Tinago being a provincial hero, his family automatically qualifies to get benefits from the government. His children will be taken care of. It is now up to you to choose where you want him to be buried, but the state will make sure all resources needed are available. Whether you bury him at the Provincial Heroes’ Acre or at his rural home, he still remains a hero who fought for the country through sports,” said Ncube. Boniface Pombi, the Tinago family spokesperson expressed gratitude to the government for the gesture. “As a family we are very grateful and we feel honoured that our brother has been declared a provincial hero. He is a hero indeed because he raised the country’s flag high through boxing. Tinago will be laid to rest on Sunday at the Provincial Heroes’ Acre in Gweru,” said Pombi.
