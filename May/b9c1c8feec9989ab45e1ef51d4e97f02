Lovemore Zigara in Gweru A potentially explosive game is on the cards when perennial campaigners ZPC Munyati take on pacesetters Whawha in a Zimbabwe General Medical Aid Fund sponsored Central Region Soccer League this afternoon. ZPC Munyati, fifth on the table, need nothing other than a victory to put their campaign back on track in a tight championship race where the top nine teams in the 12 team league are still in with a chance to land the sole promotional ticket from the region. Whawha come into the game as favourites if current form is anything to go by. Luke Petros-Jukulile, the Whawha gaffer conceded that it is going to be a tough match but expressed confidence of posting a “positive result.” “It’s going to be a tough match especially playing against ZPC Munyati who have a good home record. We are going there to compete and I am confident that we will come out with a positive result,” said the former Warriors striker. His counterpart, Isaac Nyabvure said he would want to maximise on home advantage to collect the three points at stake. “Playing against Whawha is always tough because they have the experience but we have to use our home advantage so that we come out with a good result,” Nyabvure said. “We need to win at all costs so that we still remain in contention with the other chasing pack,” he added. Elsewhere, Ivan Hoe entertain second TelOne at Amaveni where the home side will also be looking at nothing short of victory to revive their faltering campaign. The Kwekwe-based side are ninth on the table. Ivan Hoe mentor Julius Chakupewa said they will be looking to collect maximum points. “We are playing to win like we always do. We are not in a good position on the log and we want to improve on that,” he said.
