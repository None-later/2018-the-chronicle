Sports Reporter SOUTH African-based Zimbabwe businessman Cuthbert Ncube has pledged to source uniforms for the 10 teams in the Thembalethu Southern Region Women’s Soccer League. Ncube said the league’s executive approached him seeking assistance, with particular emphasis being on the provision of soccer uniforms. “I was approached by some officials from the Women’s Soccer League and I have considered their plea and  I’m working on sourcing uniforms for teams in the league. I’m actually looking at coming up with a full complement; this is the entire standard equipment and attire worn by players,” said Ncube. He said it was important to ensure the girl child was included in various spheres of life. “I am of the view that the girl child has to be accorded the same opportunities as boys. “I also believe the girl child can excel in sport if given the same support given to boys,” he said. Ncube has a number of business interests in the tourism industry and is the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) Africa regional vice president. “In 2017 we (UNWTO Africa) organised a soccer tournament in East London (South Africa) and I intend to bring the same concept here where a tournament involving all women’s teams will be held,” he said.
