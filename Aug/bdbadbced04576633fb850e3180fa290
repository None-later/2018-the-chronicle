Response to “Mutendi deplores post-election violence”. Chamisa and Biti incited the violence and they should pay for it. Such behaviour is unacceptable. — Michael Zengwa. Response to “AFZ hails new dispensation” Great to see that so many people support ED and his desire to build a new Zimbabwe. —Hunda Cary. Response to “Chamisa missed recount deadline”. Chamisa thought pushing for the postponement of the inauguration of the legitimate President could elevate him into office. Pathetic!!! — Ezekiel. Response to “Govt opens doors to youths: President”. God bless our President for giving youths a chance to show their skills and make Zimbabwe a better country! — Via email Response to “We were too hopeful about Zimbabwe . . .”. Genius stuff! I never liked Chamisa even when many around me were crazily in support of him. He’s now holding the whole nation to ransom for his ambitions. — Zvimba. If he had not ordered the mob into the city protests none of the shootings would have happened. A series of unfortunate events totally avoidable. Sad. — Haru
