INDUSTRY and Commerce Minister, Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu, will meet businesses in Bulawayo today as the city hosts the Competition and Tariff Commission (CTC) conference. The event is being organised as part of global Competition Day celebrations under the theme: “Digital Economy Innovation and Competition”. The commission said in a statement that official proceedings would start this morning at 8AM at a local hotel.
