 Grace Nyoni, Midlands Reporter THE Gweru City Council is struggling to provide services after ratepayers’ debt ballooned by $3 million to $58 million in the last four months. The debt was pegged at $55 million as at March 26 this year and has increased to $58 million. In an interview recently, the city’s spokesperson, Mr Manford Gambiza, said non-payment of water bills and rates by residents and companies negatively affected operations of the council, which he said was now failing to meet its service delivery targets. “We are currently being owed by residents and companies over $58 million. However, we continue working towards recovering the debt through the revenue enhancement team which was put in place sometime ago,” said Mr Gambiza. He said the debt is negatively affecting service delivery as the local authority also owes $45 million to service providers. “This has made water supply, roads rehabilitation, sewer reticulation and solid waste management a challenge to deliver to expectations,” said Mr Gambiza He said service delivery would improve if residents and companies cleared their debts. “Residents and companies that owe the council are encouraged to come forward and make payment plans so that the service delivery can improve,” Mr Gambiza said. The revenue enhancement team extended discounts to residents and companies who were willing to settle their debts.
