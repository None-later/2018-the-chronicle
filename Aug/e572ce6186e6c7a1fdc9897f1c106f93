 Yemurai Ushamba, Court Reporter A 49-YEAR-OLD Bulawayo man has appeared in court for allegedly assaulting his wife after she declined to withdraw a maintenance case that was granted in her favour. Elias Rutanhira (49) allegedly assaulted Claudia Ngwenya (42) after she refused to withdraw her maintenance case against him. Rutanhira pleaded guilty to physical abuse charges before Western Commonage magistrate Ms Tancy Dube. Ms Dube fined him $50 or 50 days in prison. Prosecuting, Ms September Dube said on Tuesday last week at around 8PM, Rutanhira and his wife had an argument over the maintenance issue. “He started complaining over the issue of garnished maintenance payments and requested Ngwenya to withdraw her case. She refused and this did not go down well with Rutanhira. He hit her twice on the face using his hands,” she said. The matter was reported to the police leading to his arrest. The court heard that Ngwenya did not suffer any physical injuries.—@YUshamba
