Elvis ‘The Bulawayo Bomber’ Moyo Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter WORLD Boxing Federation (WBF) All-Africa heavyweight champion Elvis Moyo’s European break hangs in the balance after his Croatian opponent Ivica Perkovic pulled out of next month’s fight. Moyo, whose stage name is Bulawayo Bomber, was supposed to be among a group of five African boxers that will trade leather at a bill dubbed “Europe versus Africa” in Vienna, Austria, on March 16. In an interview from his South African base yesterday, Moyo said his promoters Kalakoda Promotions are working on getting him an opponent that can fight him on short notice. Should they fail to get a substitute fighter, this will be Moyo’s second time in five months to miss an opportunity to fight in Europe. The Zimbabwean boxer missed out on the last leg of the Europe versus Africa held in Manchester, United Kingdom, in November last year when his opponent chickened out at the last minute. “There are things that you can’t control and at the moment I’m just training with the hope that I get an opponent. I’ve just been told that Perkovic has pulled out and I don’t know whether my team will be able to pull something fast and get me an opponent at such notice. I really wanted to fight in Europe because breaking into that market would’ve opened lots of avenues for more international fights,” said Moyo. South African heavyweight champion Ruann Visser will captain Team Africa in Vienna. The other boxers set to travel to Austria include Namibia’s duo of light heavyweight pugilists Vikapita Meroro and Wilberforce Shihepo as well as Zimbabwean cruiserweight boxer Sting Gonarenda. @ZililoR
