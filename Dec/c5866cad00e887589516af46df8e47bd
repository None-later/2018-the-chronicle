The Chronicle Response to “Last-minute sales boom for retailers”. After all this you hear people speculating that shops in Zimbabwe are empty and the prices are so high. What, then, are people buying with? Private media should stop spreading lies and tarnishing the name of Zimbabwe. – P Zengeni. Response to “Cooking oil price up again”. Cooking oil is a health hazard. Why should it be treated as a basic commodity? It is better to subsidise soap and toothpaste than cooking oil. I know a few people will agree with me. – Ziyabheda. Response to “Striking doctors suspended”.
I applaud the Government for this. This just shows that junior doctors do not care about their jobs let alone the health of patients. All they want is money. Everyone else in public service is getting paid in bond notes. How special are they to demand their salaries in United States dollars? – Concerned Citizen. Response to “Car and truck head-on kills four on the spot”. Sad! May the Lord comfort their families! By the way, @Chronicle, Fort Rixon is not along the Bulawayo-Harare Road. It’s only a turn-off to Fort Rixon. — Siduduzane.
