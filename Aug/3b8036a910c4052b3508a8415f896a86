 Leonard Ncube in Hwange BUSINESSES in Matabeleland North should brace for a new economic order for development in the province. This was said by Whange Show Society chairperson Mr Herbert Sansole following a successful Hwange Agricultural Show that ended on Saturday. A record 50-plus exhibitors including big organisations and small businesses showcased at this year’s edition of the expo, an increase from last year’s 42. Organisers of the show said the renewed interest in the exhibition was a sign of better days ahead. “The theme, ‘Leveraging the new economic order,’ calls on all of us to join the new dispensation and add value to production and operations to improve the economy. “Devolution of power is coming to the province and we should be ready to take it forward and improve our province,” he said. Mr Sansole said the Hwange Agricultural Show has potential to turn around the fortunes of Matabeleland North if companies and businesses work together. He said this year exhibitors including Parliament of Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe School Examination Council, Industrial Trade Testing and small scale farmers were among new comers to the show while a number of traditional exhibitors had expressed interest in taking permanent stands. Guest of honour, Mrs Siphathisiwe Nkomo, an executive manager at Makomo Resources said it was encouraging that women were among the exhibitors. “I have toured around the exhibition stands and I am impressed by what I saw. Women are doing great judging by the variety of things they are showcasing,” she said. Some of the exhibitors at the show which started on Wednesday were the Rural Electrification Fund, Painted Dog, Registry Office, Westgate Industrial Training Centre, Zimbabwe National Road Administration, the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, Zesa, Makomo Resources, Hwange Colliery Company Limited, Grain Marketing Board, Zimbabwe National Army, Zimbabwe Republic Police, Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service among others. @ncubeleon
