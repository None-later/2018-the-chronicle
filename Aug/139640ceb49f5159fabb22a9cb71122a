Rahman Gumbo Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter SOUTH African National First Division side Witbank Spurs have given legendary former Highlanders’ player and coach Rahman Gumbo a one-year performance related contract, Chronicle Sport can reveal. Gumbo, who is also assistant coach to Sunday Chidzambwa in the senior national team, dumped ambitious Zifa Southern Region Division One side Makomo, who he had joined with a mandate of taking them to the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League. But the decorated Gumbo reportedly found a better offer from the South African side and decided to cross the Limpopo River. “I can confirm that Gumbo is our head coach. He signed a one-year contract with us with an option to renew at the end of the season,” said Witbank Spurs chief executive officer Freddy Mapulane yesterday. Contacted for comment, a clearly shocked Makomo chief executive officer Mernard Mayera said they have been left with no option, but to move on and replace Gumbo. “It’s now beyond us. We just have to find a replacement and for now we will have Tapela Ngwenya in charge of the team,” said Mayera. Gumbo left Makomo in mid-table with 21 points at the season’s halfway mark, trailing leaders Hwange by 13 points. Gumbo has won numerous accolades in Malawi, Botswana and Zimbabwe before his latest appointment. “He has always wanted to coach in South Africa and when Witbank came knocking, he quickly took up the offer. It must be noted that he was on a healthy cheque at Makomo, probably better than most Premiership coaches on the domestic scene, but he couldn’t let the opportunity of coaching in SA elude him,” said a friend close to the 54-year-old Gumbo. Gumbo will be one of two Zimbabweans to be in charge of South African sides this season after Dynamos legend Kaitano Tembo, who is at SuperSport United, albeit on an acting capacity although indications are that club management want to make him substantive.
