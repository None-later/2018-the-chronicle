Dr Thokozani Khupe Daniel Nemukuyu, Harare Bureau THE Constitutional Court has postponed indefinitely the case in which “fired” MDC-T vice president Dr Thokozani Khupe is challenging the legality of her expulsion from Parliament. The postponement was agreed upon by the parties involved to allow the High Court to first decide on who, between Mr Nelson Chamisa and Dr Khupe, is the legitimate successor of the late party president Mr Morgan Tsvangirai. Dr Khupe, through her lawyer Professor Lovemore Madhuku, offered to pay legal costs of the day. The High Court is also expected to rule on the legitimate leader who would use the party name and symbols between the two rivals. The High Court matter filed under Number HC1051/18, will be heard on an urgent basis. Dr Khupe, who was the MDC-T Proportional Representation Member of Parliament, was expelled from the August House recently after appointed co-vice president Mr Nelson Chamisa wrote to National Assembly Speaker Advocate Jacob Mudenda, claiming that she no longer represented the opposition party’s interests. Advocate Thabani Mpofu appeared for Adv Mudenda while Advocates Sylvester Hashiti and Tawanda Zhuwarara acted for the MDC-T Chamisa faction. Prof Madhuku argued that the court should determine whether or not Parliament fulfilled its Constitutional obligation of ensuring that a seat of a National Assembly member can only be lost strictly in accordance with the Constitution. Mr Chamisa, who has had a nasty fall out with Dr Khupe over the leadership of the opposition party after the death of Mr Tsvangirai, recalled Dr Khupe from Parliament after his faction’s national council unanimously agreed to expel her from the party. Dr Khupe was accused of misconduct and intransigence.
