Itayi ‘Iyati’ Takaendesa Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent STAR FM’s mid morning show, The Breeze started broadcasting from South Africa yesterday as the radio station expands its reach to the people in Polokwane. The Breeze that airs on Star FM weekdays from 9AM to midday has hosts Mai Judah and Olla broadcasting from Capricorn FM studios – the largest commercial radio station in Limpopo, courtesy of Events Evolution. The broadcast will end on Friday. Those who travelled with the presenters include engineer Weddington Mbodzi and producer Clement Banda. Star FM programming manager Itayi “Iyati” Takaendesa said the radio station was expanding into the region hence the broadcast in South Africa. “Now that we’ve practically conquered Zimbabwe with over 55 percent urban listenership, we’re beginning to grow into the region. We want to experience other markets, what other radio stations are doing and showcase brand Star FM through The Breeze in South Africa,” said Iyati. She said they wanted to interact with diverse cultures in line with the Mother Tongue March activation which encourages people to speak in their mother tongue. “It’s also part of our Mother Tongue month activation. The Venda culture is mostly predominating in Polokwane hence we want to interact with that culture and language. We want to know the artistes and their music,” said Iyati.
