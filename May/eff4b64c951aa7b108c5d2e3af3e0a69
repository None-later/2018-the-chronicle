 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter MATABELELAND North Volleyball Association chairperson Sifiso Buhlungu says his organisation has shifted all its focus to developing and improving the game in the province. Buhlungu said this yesterday when Freeplans Marketing donated volleyball equipment for distribution to seven schools in the province. Mabhikwa, David Livingstone and Mosi Oa Tunya will benefit in the secondary schools’ category, while Clonmore, Tshabanda, Nkayi and Binga will be the primary schools’ beneficiaries. The equipment consists of sports bags and satchels. Sport and Recreation Commission Matabeleland North provincial coordinator Newman Masuku also chipped in by donating two volleyball nets and balls. “From a volleyball perspective, this is good when we are aiming to grow the sport at the grassroots level. I believe this is what every other sport code wants to encourage. We should have more people coming to help so the growth of the game becomes inevitable,” said Buhlungu. Freeplans Marketing representative Joseph Dzimati said: “As part of our social corporate responsibility initiative, we decided to donate to Matabeleland North Volleyball because we want to see the sport growing in that part of the country. We hope the gesture will motivate the learners to take the sport seriously. We are here to build brand volleyball and so we will continue to work with the association.” Matabeleland North has had no meaningful volleyball action over the years. The association held a national Level One coaching course to empower coaches identify and groom upcoming stars in Bulawayo last week. The course was aimed at equipping coaches to adequately train beginners up to professional clubs. A total of 19 coaches from Tsholotsho, Hwange, Lupane and Nkayi attended the course.
