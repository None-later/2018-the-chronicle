Midlands Bureau REDCLIFF municipality has started rehabilitating the busy Zisco Road which is expected to cost nearly $300 000. Town clerk Mr Gilson Chakauya said the rehabilitation works involves the resealing and installation of 20 street lights along Zisco Road which starts from corner of Redcliff turn-off along the Harare-Bulawayo Highway. “The contractor who won the tender is already on the ground and work has started. They have started resealing after which they’ll install 20 street lights and the whole project is expected to cost nearly $300 000. The road is very important to us as it links Redcliff to the Harare-Bulawayo Highway. It is also our busiest road,” he said. The rehabilitation project is part of measures being put in place to improve service delivery ahead of the resumption of production at the giant steel works, Zisco. Government has since reached a deal with a Chinese firm that will revive Zisco which used to be Redcliff town’s biggest employer. Redcliff town was dependent on Zisco which paid the bulk of its rates and its revival with therefore breathe new life in the mining town. Mr Chakauya said council had also requested funds from the Zimbabwe National Road Administration for the rehabilitation of Rutendo road which was now in a sorry state. “We will then be left with one huge project in terms of road maintenance which is Rutendo road. It’s also busy and we hope Zinara will release funds to that effect,” he said. The local authority is also planning to install about 20 solar powered street lights along Zisco Road and other roads in the town.
