SKYZ Metro FM’s Nkokhelo Khumalo popularly known as, Khekhe, is set to battle it out with radio veterans in the Zim Hip-hop awards. He has been into radio for only a year but has showed his prowess behind the microphone as his show 16 Bars got a nomination in the Zim Hip-hop awards and he will be the youngest in his category. Khekhe will battle it out with more illustrious MCs such as Thorn Laroq from Khulumani FM, Star FM’s DJ Mox, Power FM’s Promethius and the duo of Lady K and PD from ZiFM Stereo. In an interview Khekhe said his show has been there for less than eight months. “16 Bars is a Hip-hop show which started this year and it has been running for less than eight months and am so happy that I’ll be in competition with prominent radio personalities like Thorn Laroq, Mox of StarFM, Promethius, Lady K and PD,” he said. Bubbling with confidence he said he felt like he deserved to take home this accolade. “I think I do deserve this award because my show is one of a kind as it covers local music only. For example, my show plays 90 percent local music. I believe it has played a major role in the hip-hop industry by uncovering artistes who were not known and making them household names,” said Khekhe. The Lupane State University student said he wants to develop this show to become one of the best in Zimbabwe. “I think next year we are going to do more live shows so that fans can meet their favourite artistes and interact, thus creating our own celebrities,” said Khekhe. Apart from being a radio presenter, Khekhe, is also a football player and he once played for Highlanders Juniors alongside Knox Mtizwa, Teenage Hadebe and others.—@_sizibanigel
