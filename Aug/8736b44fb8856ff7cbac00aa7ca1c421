Joseph Muchechetere Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter ALL sporting and recreational organisations in Zimbabwe have been urged to regularise their operations by ensuring that they’re registered and licensed by the Sports and Recreation Commission. In a notice flighted in the media yesterday, the SRC said any sport and recreational body not licensed and registered by the end of September will be sanctioned in line with standing statutes. “The Sports and Recreation Commission is mandated in terms of the SRC Act (Chapter 25:15), among other things, to coordinate, control, develop and foster the activities of sport and recreation in the country, register all organisations undertaking the promotion of sport and recreation activities in the country, to ensure the proper administration of organisations undertaking the promotion of sport and recreation, promote the highest standards of sportsmanship, authorise national and international sporting and recreational activities, register any sport and recreation facility as well as oversee training programmes for sports persons,” read a notice signed by SRC acting director-general Joseph Muchechetere. The affected organisations include community sport and recreation clubs, academies, country and sports clubs, wards, district, provincial as well as national sport and recreation associations. It said all sport and recreation structures under schools, tertiary institutions, local authorities, mining, churches, voluntary, uniformed services, state enterprises and parastatals must also comply with the requirements and maintain a register of their members. The SRC also indicated that all members of such organisations whether active or not were liable to pay an annual levy of $4 to the commission. As part of ensuring accountability and adherence to the statutes, no sporting or recreational organisation shall enter or leave the country without clearance from the SRC. “Failure to comply will result in the Sports and Recreation Commission instituting sanctions against such errant organisations in pursuit of implementing the mandate and in accordance with the commission’s regulatory role,” read the notice.
