Roy Mazingi Mukudzei Chingwere, Midlands Bureau MIDLANDS Provincial Affairs Minister Owen Ncube yesterday handed over proceeds raised in a memorial fund-raising tournament held for the late Chapungu goalkeeper, Roy Mazingi, to his family at a function held at Josiah Tungamirai Airforce base. Chapungu organised a four-team tournament which featured their provincial rivals FC Platinum, Shabanie Mine and Nichrut in memory of their former goalkeeper who died early this year. The tournament raised more than $5 600 and a food hamper was handed to the family yesterday. Ncube urged the Mazingi family to let the proceeds help his young family and thanked the tournament organisers for the goodwill gesture. “Cash was raised to look after the family of the deceased but this money must not be abused, the money must be used to look after the family of the deceased, that is the upkeep of the children and the wife. “I would like to thank the organisers of the event for remembering our their former player,” said Ncube. Chapungu chairperson Doubt Ncube said it was their way of showing how they value the contribution made by their former son. “We appreciate what he did for us and this is a way to show that we value their contribution to the club. “Our players are important to us and we just wanted to show that through this tournament, the funds that were raised will also help to take care of his family,” said Ncube. The Mazingi family spokesperson, Enita Siyakisa, said losing a loved one was painful but knowing that his colleagues value him gives the family some comfort. “Roy is late now and it is painful that we lost him but to know that his colleagues and bosses value him gives us some relief as a family. “We want to thank everyone who helped in any way from the time we lost Roy and up until now we are still receiving a lot of assistance and I just want to say thank you,” said Siyakisa.
