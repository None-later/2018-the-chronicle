Willard Katsande MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane says Kaizer Chiefs’ combative midfielder Willard Katsande ‘bullies everybody’ and Teenage Hadebe should have been sent off. Chiefs and Sundowns settled for a share of the spoils after playing to a goalless draw on Saturday night. Mosimane did not take too kindly to some of Katsande’s challenges during the encounter. “(Teenage) Hadebe was very lucky. He should have got a second yellow, you know, and we knew Katsande would come and kick, but we said we must kick him back because he bullies everybody. “I instructed (Tiyani) Mabunda: ‘If he kicks you, kick him back. If he gets away with it, you will get away with it.’” Mosimane admits they adopted a cautious approach, but kept it clean and simple. “We just kept it clean and simple. We’re a bit cautious though, but Denis (Onyango) didn’t have much to do to save everything. It showed once again he is the top keeper and number one in South Africa,” he added. “I never thought he would stop Brockie’s shot, but he was well aware and did very well. We were a little bit unfortunate hitting the post twice. “We didn’t allow them to play their transition game as always. So we let Cardoso and Hadebe have the ball and try and force Hadebe into a second yellow card, which he was very, very lucky not to get.” – Soccer Laduma
