In Kwekwe, Jane Muchemedzi went missing in a suspected case of kidnapping. Muchemedzi of Mbizo Section 12 was last seen on Saturday at home, where she stays with her uncle. The uncle, Mr Abisai Muchemedzi, said his niece was doing Form 1 at Mbizo High School and she just disappeared while she was doing household chores around 7 in the evening. “She was at home doing household chores but we suddenly discovered that she was nowhere to be seen. I had just returned from the farm and was trying to settle down,” said Mr Muchemedzi. Mr Muchemedzi said she was last seen wearing denim pants and a red top adding he fears Jane could have been abducted. “You never know, these days when cases of people who are going around kidnapping children, I fear they might have taken her for ritual killings,” he said. He, however, did not rule out the possibility that Jane “might have eloped with a friend.” “She has a small body that does not match her age. I am pleading with anyone who might have information on her whereabouts to inform the nearest police station or call me directly on 0785 218 020,” he said. He said he had been staying with his niece since she was doing Grade Four after the passing on of her father. — @SlyCee10
