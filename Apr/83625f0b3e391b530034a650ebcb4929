 Leonard Ncube,  Showbiz Reporter A 27-year-old Binga woman has released a six-track gospel album. Sibongile Muleya who grew up in Manjolo and Kariangwe areas, encouraged other musicians from Binga to work together to develop themselves and music in the district. Her album titled Pfee Munyasha is trending and has been played in some local radio stations. She said she decided to venture into gospel music and composed the album following the death of her elder sister a few years ago. “I started music in 2016 and released my first album Pfee Munyasha last year. People like my album especially the title track and the Tonga songs. I take this album as my direct communication with God because of what he has done to me. I almost killed myself after the death of my sister. God guided me and that’s why I came up with songs like UJesu wami and Pfee Munyasha,” said Muleya, whose stage name is Bongie Mamale. She said as a budding artiste she was willing to work with others to develop music in her rural district. “There are a few singers from Binga and we should acknowledge each other and even collaborate for betterment of music in our district,” she said. Muleya said Pfee Munyasha is about her personal life as she sings about what she went through as a result of growing without parents and is now thanking God for seeing her through. She also composed UJesu wami, a praise and worship song about her life. Muleya, based in Entumbane suburb, said the other songs are Mukaloti, a Tonga jam asking God for a gift of listening, Ndakulumbisa lyeza, Tamba and Mzalwane which are all praise songs. – @ncubeleon
