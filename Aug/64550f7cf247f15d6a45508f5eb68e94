President Mnangagwa Editor – The new administration has done great so far and we expect to see more. Many enterprises have opened and new policies adopted. The goal of economic growth is to increase the quantity and value of products and services produced in the economy to fulfil all the needs in services of the people and export markets. The open for business mantra and that of doing business is important and already taking effect. Policies similar to the indigenisation laws still exist around the world in successfully developing countries such as China, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, etc. There aren’t many countries which are successfully transitioning from low income to high income status in the last 60 years. All those countries had laws close to the indigenisation. They call it “investment regulations”, “positive list” or “negative list”. What is important is to stay focused on diversifying the economy, increasing the quantity and value of goods and services produced locally through job creation and support or protection to enterprises. Designing local products and manufacturing equipment is also important. Martin, Harare  What USA wants to achieve will remain a dream USA wants to bully us into submitting to their demands of making sure that the MDC is placed at the helm of Zimbabwean leadership. It is imposing illegal sanctions upon us to ensure that the masses suffer, and vote the MDC into power. The MDC will then be viewed as the messiah of Zimbabwe. It should be known to the USA that its dreams of seeing an MDC-led Zimbabwe will never come to fruition. We should exploit more of our natural resources, utilise our human capital more effectively, and develop our infrastructure and technological environment. We should engage more with friendly countries within Sadc, AU, and countries like China, Russia, Brazil, India, to assist us in realising our full potential. – Bodo.
