 Ellina Mhlanga, Harare Bureau TOP karateka Samson Muripo’s achievements continue to be recognised after the Nepal So-kyokushin Karate Association invited him to take part in their First International tournament this month. The competition is pencilled for February 9 and 10 at Satdobato, Lalitpur. Muripo was invited together with Tangayi Mhlanga and Pumulani Maposa, a development that also reflects the impact local athletes have made in regional and international events. Muripo, who has moved his training base to South Africa, told The Herald yesterday he will take advantage of the tournament to gauge his state of preparedness for other tournaments lined up for this year. He will fight for honours in the open weight category. “I have been in the trenches training throughout the festive season, preparing for the busy year. I am on the right path to victory. “I am using it as the barometer of my 2018 path. I hope to represent my country with distinction, as is always the case, it’s not an easy path,” said Muripo. The renowned fighter is set to go for the All Japan Karate tournament taking place on April 14 and 15 in Shizouka Prefecture, Japan, which is usually a bigger event as it attracts some of the world’s best. The inclusion of Mhlanga and Maposa has also impressed the seasoned fighter, who is Zimbabwe So-kyokushin Karate Do Organisation branch chief and Africa development officer for World So-kyokushin “I just hope we will secure sponsorship for them to travel as they have proved to be religious followers of the champion’s radar,” said Muripo. Following a successful year, in 2017 when he was crowned the Sportsperson of the Year after capping a fine year that saw him claiming gold in the open weight category at the Third International So-Kyokushin Karate tournament in Ahvaz, Iran. He also took a silver and a bronze medal at the same event in the Under-90kg and kata competition.
