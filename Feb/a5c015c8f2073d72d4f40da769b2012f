Prince Kaybee Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls SOUTH Africa’s DJ Prince Kaybee says he is not giving up on his chase for a possible House music collaboration with international R&B star Rihanna. The multi award winning Prince Kaybee last year said he would quit music if he failed to lure Rihanna to feature in his single, after releasing his second album in September. Come 2018 the Free State-born 28-year-old is still in music despite having failed to bring Rihanna to his ship. He claims he was misquoted. The Better Days hit-maker played at the 2017 iFlix Victoria Falls Carnival where he told Chronicle Entertainment that he was taken out of context when it was reported that he would quit music if he failed to collaborate with Rihanna. Prince Kaybee said: “I think it was a bit put out of context. I said I would like to work with Rihanna and I wouldn’t release for a few months if it doesn’t work. I am still working on that and my office is still making efforts to get in touch with her.” He said he was hopeful for a collabo with the international female muso, who he has expressed interest to work on a house music track in the past. Both singers are signed under Universal Records South Africa and USA respectively. Prince Kaybee has been to Bulawayo and Harare a couple of times and said he is willing to work with any local artiste who is into house music. “I am promising more music in 2018. I want collabos but none come though and I don’t know what’s happening. I am looking forward to someone coming up,” he added. Born Kabelo Motsamai, Prince Kaybee grew up in the small town of Senekal near Welkom in the Free State and is the youngest of 36 children. @ncubeleon
