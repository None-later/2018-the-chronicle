 Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter ANOTHER baby has drowned in Bulawayo within a week after falling in a bucket while her mother was cleaning the house. The one-year-old girl from Nkulumane suburb was playing alone in their house’s corridor when she allegedly crawled into the toilet and fell into a bucket that had water. This incident occurred on Wednesday morning. Ms Lubelihle Sipepa (21) discovered that her baby had drowned when she went to check for her. “The baby’s head was inside the bucket while her legs were outside. The mother took the baby out of the water and tried to render first aid but the baby had already died. She informed neighbours and the matter was reported to the police,” said a neighbour who preferred anonymity. Bulawayo Metropolitan police spokesperson Inspector Precious Simango confirmed the incident. “We received a case of sudden death of a one-year-old baby who fell into a bucket and drowned yesterday (Wednesday) morning. The baby’s mother was inside cleaning the bedroom when her baby fell into a bucket that was in the toilet. “We encourage mothers to always keep their babies in sight to avoid such accidents. Babies crawl and walk at any time and so there is a need to always monitor them to protect them from being injured or even losing their lives like in this incident,” she said. Insp Simango said it was saddening to note that another baby had drowned in Cowdray park suburb on Monday. She urged parents and guardians to be careful to avoid similar deaths. On Monday, a three-year-old baby walked outside the house to a well and drowned while his mother was allegedly having sex at her boyfriend’s house. Police rescued the couple as angry Cowdray Park residents were baying for their blood, accusing them of being irresponsible by “causing” the drowning of the baby.—@winnie_masara
