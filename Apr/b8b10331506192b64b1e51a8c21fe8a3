Mr Pikirayi Deketeke Harare Bureau ZIMPAPERS chief executive officer Mr Pikirayi Deketeke has commended Government for its commitment to combat cyber security threats through partnership with the media house. Speaking at a Cyber Security conference organised by Zimpapers and the Ministry of Information Communication Technology and Cyber Security yesterday, Mr Deketeke said the media company found it necessary to organise such an indaba. He said cyber security was an important subject as abuse of internet was fast becoming a problem. “There are now many players who use the internet through different devices and this makes their information more vulnerable,” said Mr Deketeke. “As a media company, we found it an interest to protect the cyber space and our commitment and speciality is to the creation of platforms for citizens and experts to dialogue about issues that are of concern to them. “This is one such platforms that we created so that experts in the ICT sector come together and deliberate on the issues that are affecting cyber security and come up with solutions to fix them.” Mr Deketeke acknowledged efforts Government was putting in place to ensure safety of the nation from cyber abuse. “There is a lot of investment placed into creating out national space and that is why these deliberations are taking place because even as a company we also commit to protecting our cyber security from hackers,” he said. The two-day conference was held at the Celebration Centre in Harare, with Zimpapers’ publications, The Herald and Chronicle being the official media partners. Other partners are Econet Wireless, Grant Thornton, the Zimbabwe Information Communication Technology and the Harare Institute of Technology.
