 Shamiso Dzingire, Business Reporter LOW-COST airline, Fastjet, says it will include first item of checked luggage and on-board refreshments in all tickets sold in a move meant to enhance client product satisfaction. Previously, the airline charged all luggage and on-board snacks separately. Chief executive officer Mr Nico Bezuidenhout confirmed the development saying the new fare product would be available on all new routes as well as existing network points effective August 6 2018. Fastjet said the decision was informed by research into market trends and customer expectations with the airline exchanging its BigSaver and Achiever fares for the new-look, value product. “We have listened to our customers and redeveloped our product to better match what travellers on our network expect from a value-airline,” said Mr Bezuidenhout. “Beyond the redevelopment of our product, Fastjet is presently working on wider distribution and more payment methods, growing our network and making it easier for everyone to do business with us.” Recently, the airline launched daily flights between Harare and Bulawayo becoming the first low-cost airliner to operate the route. It has also added frequency between Harare and Dar es Salaam in Tanzania on Wednesdays and introduced double daily flights between Maputo and Beira in Mozambique. @ShamisoDzingire
