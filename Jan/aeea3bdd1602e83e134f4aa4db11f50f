Joey Antipas and Prince Matore Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter CHICKEN INN players returned for pre-season training under the watchful eyes of returning assistant coach Prince Matore and new goalkeepers’ coach Tirivaviri Sithole. Chicken Inn have re-united with their 2015 championship winning coach Joey Antipas but Matore took charge of the GameCocks’ first training session of 2018 in the absence of Antipas. They have recalled some of their players from loan spells for assessment and among them are striker Adrian Banana, who was with 2018 Premiership debutants Bulawayo Chiefs. A number of players also tried their luck with the former champions, with the most recognisable faces being forward Joe Nyabinde from Shabanie Mine and defender Kudzai Chideu, who was at How Mine last season. Tendai Ngulube, who has been dropped by Highlanders, watched the training session from the terraces. “I am happy with the turn out of the players, it is good to see some of the familiar faces who were here when we won the championship. The important thing now is to get the players in shape in terms of fitness. As it is, we have a large pool of players in training and most of them are from our development side,” said Matore. “We will have a look at them and see what they can do. We will obviously look for additions, whom l am confident will be here by next week. The objective of every coach is to excel and we are no exception.” Some of the players that were present yesterday were Guide Goddard, Clemence Matawu, Innocent Muchaneka, Thabani Goredema, Ben Nyahunzvi, Moses Jackson, Brian Juru, Devine Lunga, Thabani Goredema, Christopher Samakweri and George Majika. @innocentskizoe
