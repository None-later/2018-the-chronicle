 TEN Zimbabwean companies are set to showcase their products at DRC Mining Week Expo from 13th to the 15th of this month under the ZimTrade banner. The expo will be held in Lubumbashi and is expected to open new markets for local products in the DRC following a market survey conducted by ZimTrade in October 2016. Zimbabwean companies will be showcasing pinch valves, mining roof support elements, rail track accessories, beaters and crucibles among other products. The DRC Mining Week, the largest mining and industrial platform in the DRC, will provide a platform for Zimbabwean companies to not only showcase their products but to also meet potential buyers from the region. It is expected that at the end of the expo, Zimbabwean companies would have established business contacts and generated export orders in the DRC. The participation by Zimbabwe at the expo is a bold step, which aims to further explore the DRC market, which is considered a high risk market. “ZimTrade is therefore encouraging local companies to venture into the highly lucrative DRC market,” said the agency.  Zimbabwe and DRC are both members of Sadc. However, the DRC is yet to ratify the SADC Trade Protocol which offers preferential treatment to qualifying products into each other’s market.  —ZimTrade newsletter
