Lovemore Zigara in Gweru FC Lesaffre face another acid test tomorrow when they take on TelOne at Ascot Stadium in a Zimbabwe General Medical Aid Fund Central Region Soccer League encounter. Both FC Lesaffre and TelOne are unbeaten coming into the encounter.  They both have been touted as favourites to land the sole promotional ticket into the premiership. However, the teams were cautious ahead of the match with FC Lesaffre gaffer Peter Manoti removing the favourites tag from his team saying he is in the league to give his young lads exposure. “We are never under pressure to perform because ours is to develop players. The game is good for our players because it is a test measure for their development,” he said. His counterpart former Highlanders and Warriors winger Joel Lupahla reasoned it will be a tough match and said they will bank on home advantage. “We are a new team if you look at it because we started rebuilding with new players. We are just trying to make the team play as a unit but we are at home and we expect a positive result. FC Lesaffre are a good team who have a very experienced coach but we will try and compete for three points,” said Lupahla. Elsewhere, table toppers Whawha face another crunch tie when they host MSU in a Gweru derby. Chekera Pasi will be banking on their untainted home record where they have won all the games they have played so far this season while the Varsity Sharks will be looking to avoid a defeat to ensure that they remain in the promotional mix.
