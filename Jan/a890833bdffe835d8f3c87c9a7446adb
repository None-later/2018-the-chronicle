ZIMBABWE’S new Government is showing it is “open for business” to foreign investors, Prospect Resources, an Australian company planning to build a lithium mine east of Harare, has said. As efforts were being made to revive the economy, the Government has named the firm’s project as a priority development. Prospect Resources executive director Harry Greaves was quoted by Bloomberg saying his organisation last year signed an agreement with Beijing-based Sinomine Resources Exploration for construction, financing and off-take from the mine, which could start up by the first quarter of 2019. “We are incredibly encouraged, excited by the new attitude,” he told Bloomberg last week while in Bulawayo. “We are in contact with officials from the Ministry of Mines, the Reserve Bank Governor and President’s office. This Government is open for business.” Prospect Resources is among companies seeking to capitalise on expected surging demand for lithium because of its use in batteries for electric vehicles and energy-storage systems. Prices for lithium carbonate, a processed form of the mineral, about doubled in the past two years, according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Most of the known resources of the metal are in South America. President Emmerson Mnangagwa has promised to woo investors to revive the economy that has not been performing well over the years. Zimbabwe holds the world’s biggest platinum reserves after South Africa and also has chrome, gold, iron ore, coal and diamonds. The country is Africa’s top producer of lithium, with estimated output of 900 tonnes, according to the United States Geological Service. Last November, Prospect Resources announced that it had agreed to sell lithium concentrates to Sinomine over a seven-year period. — Bloomberg.
