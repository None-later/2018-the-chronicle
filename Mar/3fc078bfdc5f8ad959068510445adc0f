Tendayi Kasamba, Chronicle Reporter THERE is theft and vandalism of the Bulawayo-Gweru highway perimeter fence, a development that may increase accidents caused by stray animals. The Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe (TSCZ) spent about $400 to erect the perimeter fence on either side of the 162 km stretch of the highway as the road had become a death trap due accidents caused by stray animals. The fencing of the highway was completed last year but some sections of the fence have already been vandalised resulting in livestock such as cattle and donkeys straying onto the highway. TSCZ spokesperson, Mr Tatenda Chinoda, said his organisation was worried by the new development having spent so much money in trying to reduce accidents caused by stray animals. “TSCZ erected the fence to reduce accidents on the country’s roads and it is disturbing to note that some people are vandalising the fence,” he said. Matabeleland North Provincial Roads Engineer Joseph Makokobe said they were facing funding challenges to repair the vandalised sections. “We haven’t received funds to carryout maintenance work but we hope repairs on some vandalised sections will start next week. We therefore urge traditional leaders to work together with their respective communities to fight vandalism which is putting their livestock at risk of being killed on the the highway,” said Eng Makokobe. Chief Jahana said people people who were vandalising the fence were doing this at night and there was therefore a need for night patrols. He said it was important for communities to appreciate the fence was not meant to just reduce accidents but to also protect their livestock. “I urge everyone including travellers to report acts of vandalism to the police,” said Chief Jahana. — @tenkasamba “We urge traditional leaders to work together with their respective communities to fight vandalism which is putting their livestock at risk of being killed on the the highway”
