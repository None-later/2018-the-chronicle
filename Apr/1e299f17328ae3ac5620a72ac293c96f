 Codelia Mondela, Court Reporter A MAN from Madlambuzi area has been fined $300 for severely assaulting his daughter-in-law with a knobkerrie after she thrashed his wife with a Mopani switch. Lampert Ndlovu (64) assaulted Ms Ntandokayise Ndebele (32) with a knobkerrie all over her body until it broke into pieces. He took a Mopani switch and continued beating her. Ndlovu pleaded guilty to assault charges before Bulawayo regional magistrate Mrs Sibongile Msipha-Marondedze. The magistrate fined him $300. In case of default he will spend four months in prison. A further four months in jail was suspended on condition that he does not commit a similar offence in the next five years. For the State, Mr Robin Mukura said on January 26 last year, Ms Ndebele questioned Journey Sibanda, Ndlovu’s wife, about why she was spreading rumours about her in the village. “Ms Ndebele demanded to know why Sibanda accused her of ill-treating her cousin sister. Sibanda denied the allegations and this did not go well with Ms Ndebele who took a Mopani switch. “She assaulted Sibanda with the switch. Sibanda went home and reported her ordeal to her husband,” he said. “The following morning, Ndlovu armed himself with a knobkerrie and Mopani switch and went to Ms Ndebele’s homestead. Upon arrival, he demanded to know why Ms Ndebele had assaulted his wife the previous day.” The prosecutor said Ndlovu did not give his daughter-in-law a chance to answer but struck her with the knobkerrie. “He assaulted her all over the body until the knobkerrie broke into pieces. Ndlovu took the Mopani switch and continued beating her,” Mr Mukura said. Ndlovu later took Ms Ndebele to Plumtree District Hospital to get treatment.—@MondelaC
