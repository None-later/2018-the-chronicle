 Sylvester Chiramba, Court Reporter A TEACHER at Lupane Primary School has been fined $200 for kissing and fondling a former work mate. Melusi Ndlovu (49) from Cowdray Park suburb in Bulawayo indecently assaulted his 36-year-old former workmate (name withheld) from the same suburb on Thursday last week. Ndlovu and his victim had been drinking together at Cowdray Park Terminus when the former invited his former colleague to sleep over at his house. Ndlovu kissed his former colleague, who had undressed and was left with his boxer shorts, on the mouth but he expressed his displeasure by pushing him away. Ndlovu left the house to smoke and when he returned he found his former colleague, who had put on his trousers, dozing off on the bed. The man woke up to find Ndlovu, who was now naked, trying to remove his trousers while fondling his buttocks at the same time. The man told Ndlovu that he was not interested in what he was trying to do and he took his clothes and left. A police report was made leading to Ndlovu’s arrest. Ndlovu pleaded guilty to indecent assault charges when he appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Ms Tancy Dube yesterday. Ms Dube convicted him on his own plea of guilty and fined him $200. “A further six months in prison will be added to the fine but it is wholly suspended on condition that you do not commit a similar offence in the next five years,” said Ms Dube Mrs Thembeni Mpofu was representing the State. @SlyCee10
