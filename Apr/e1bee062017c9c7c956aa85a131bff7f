Mr Joseph Gunda Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter GENERAL manager for General Beltings, Mr Joseph Gunda, has been re-elected president of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries Matabeleland Chapter for another one-year term. Mr Gunda and his two vice presidents, Messrs Shepherd Chawira and Raymond Shonhiwa were re-elected at the chamber’s annual general meeting held at the group’s offices in Bulawayo yesterday. In an interview after the AGM, Mr Gunda said his team would continue with its efforts to restore Bulawayo to its industrial hub status. “I am sure our re-election means that the members have seen something in what we have been doing as people who are passionate with the development and turnaround of industries in Bulawayo. We have zeal to restore it to its original status as the hub of manufacturing in Zimbabwe and we take that challenge. “We wish to highlight to the members that we will work hard for their cause as representatives of CZI,” he said. Mr Gunda said they would also work towards pursuing the Special Economic Zones concept, which was mooted by the chamber a few years ago and has been adopted by the Government. “Following our re-election, we will have to sit down and take up from where we ended in the first year. But going forward specifically we are looking at the rebuilding of Bulawayo and one area we are focusing upon to build this initiative is the SEZs,” he said. “As l have highlighted before this is a brainchild of MCI, which was eventually raised by Government coming up with Sunway City and Victoria Falls. So for us, this is our passion, we would want to see the SEZ working as we believe this could be the panacea for resuscitation of industries in Bulawayo. Coupled with this mantra, ‘Bulawayo is open for business’ we believe we are on the right course.” @okazunga
