 Codelia Mondela, Court Reporter A MAN from Fort-Rixon allegedly struck his neighbour with a brick on the head for laughing during a misunderstanding over beer. Mandla Ngulube (29) allegedly brandished a knife accusing Mr Simon Mpofu and his friends, Zwelani Siziba, Kelvin and Philisani Nsingo of taking his opaque beer at Phuthuma Business Centre. A court heard that when Mr Mpofu laughed, Ngulube picked a brick and allegedly struck him on the head on Christmas day last year. Ngulube pleaded not guilty to attempted murder charges before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Crispen Mberewere. The magistrate remanded him in custody to March 6. Ngulube said the four men took his beer and drank it and when he tried talking to them, they stoned him. He said he was not the one who threw the stone that hit Mr Mpofu. “I retreated trying to escape and Mpofu who was staggering and approaching me from behind was struck by one of the stones. I produced a knife from my pocket intending to scare them off,” he said. Mr Mpofu said Ngulube beat him up him for laughing. “We came out of the shop carrying beer and Ngulube followed us carrying a knife and said he wanted his beer. I laughed and he turned to me saying, do you think this a joke?” he said. “He picked a half brick and struck me on the head and I fell on my left hand. Since the assault I have not been able to use my hand and I was even dismissed from my job as a cattle herder.” Prosecuting, Mr Simbarashe Manyiwa alleged that on December 25 last year, Mr Mpofu and his friends were drinking beer at the business centre. He said Ngulube claimed ownership of Mr Mpofu’s beer and they started quarrelling.“Mr Mpofu laughed during the misunderstanding. Ngulube picked a half brick and hit him on the left side of the head,” Mr Manyiwa said. — @MondelaC
