Tonderai Ndiraya Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter NGEZI Platinum Stars have maintained their early title contenders’ tag with a 100 percent record in the 18-team Castle Lager Premier Soccer League. The rich platinum side, which has made it clear that it’s going for the title in its third season in the Premiership, enjoys a two-point lead over FC Platinum and third-placed Highlanders after five games. Ngezi’s resilience paid off at the weekend with a smash-and-grab last minute Clive Augusto goal to sink Chicken Inn 1-0 at Baobab Stadium. What made this victory sweeter for Ngezi is that they collected maximum points against a Chicken Inn side that dented their 2017 title aspirations on Match Day 31 when the two sides played to a 2-2 draw at Baobab. Going into that game, Ngezi were at the top of the table, tied on 63 points with FC Platinum, who went on to win the title. The draw with Chicken Inn saw them slipping into third place. Tonderai Ndiraya, the Ngezi coach, is happy with his team’s weekend win and not shy to declare their aspirations to land the coveted Premiership title. “Winning our first five games means we have achieved our short-term target and we are now looking forward to the next target, which is 10 games. We have said from the start that our ultimate target this year is the league title and I am happy with how we have started even though I am not yet convinced with our play; we need to work on our conversion,” Ndiraya said. Unbeaten side! Ngezi are one of five sides that remain unbeaten in the Premiership. But Ngezi are yet to concede a goal in their five outings. Defending champions, FC Platinum, are second on the table, tied on 13 points with Highlanders. However, it should be noted that FC Platinum benefited from three points via the boardroom after ZPC Kariba decided not to turn-up for their season’s opener at the National Sports Stadium, as their Nyamhunga Stadium had not been cleared for topflight matches. FC Platinum were then awarded the match on a 3-0 scoreline, meaning the defending champions have sweated it out in four games. Caps United have been slowly climbing the ladder and are fifth with nine points, six behind Ngezi. They also remain unbeaten. Caps are tied on nine points with Harare City. Relegation zone! ZPC Kariba finally got off the block following their 0-0 draw against second from the bottom side Dynamos. DeMbare are in an unfamiliar position, just a point above anchors ZPC Kariba. Newly promoted side Mutare City Rovers are finding the going tough and are tied on two points with Dynamos. New boys Herentals are fourth from the bottom, tied on four points with Chapungu and Bulawayo City.
