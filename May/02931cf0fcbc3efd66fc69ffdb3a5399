Speaking on behalf of VP Mohadi, at St Columba’s Anglican Parish, Permanent Secretary in the Vice President’s Office, Reverend Paul Damasane said hunger made people unhappy, hence it was their duty to give back to the elderly. “Unfortunately, the Vice President could not make it today, but he will be at Mpilo Central Hospital in a fortnight. We do not want the elderly people to starve and that’s why we are gathered today to receive food,” he said. Salvation Army, Lutheran, Methodist, United Congregational Church of Southern Africa (UCCSA) St Margret’s Anglican Parish and Bulawayo United Residents’ Association benefited from the donation. Last month, VP Mohadi implored churches to play a leading role in preaching the gospel of peace and tolerance ahead of the forthcoming harmonised elections. He urged churches to shun corruption, saying the scourge brought untold suffering to the majority of less privileged people in the country. VP Mohadi also donated a $250 voucher to Sanitary Pads Movement founder Mr Cosmas “Tsano” Zulu. Mr Zulu said girls’ needs were being neglected compared to boys. “If we have free condoms, why don’t we have free sanitary pads? We give free condoms to people who want to do mischievous things, but we are not giving sanitary pads to girls when what happens to them is nature. We are looking after boys and not girls,” he said. @MondelaC
