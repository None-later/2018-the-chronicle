Philip Chiyangwa Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIFA president Philip Chiyangwa and his deputy Omega Sibanda have been duly elected members of parliament on a Zanu-PF ticket for Zvimba South in Mashonaland West and Vungu in the Midlands respectively. Another sport administrator Tavengwa Mukuhlani, the Zimbabwe Cricket chairman, also clinched the Mhondoro-Ngezi constituency in Mashonaland West province under a Zanu-PF ticket. Chiyangwa garnered 11 819 votes compared to his closest rival Kufakunesu Chidakwa, an independent candidate, who received 4 886, while Sibanda polled 11 350 votes to his closest rival’s 4 809. Mukhuhlani polled 12 780 votes. It was not immediately clear yesterday whether the duo of Chiyangwa and Sibanda will run for football office when the national association holds its elections on December 1, but should they choose to, they will not be the first to hold political and football office at the same time.  Omega Sibanda Caf president Ahmad, a Malagasy national, was chairman of the Madagascar Football Association and a Senator for the ruling party as well as Minister of Fisheries. Across the Limpopo, Safa president Danny Jordan was also one time mayor of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Council on an ANC ticket. In Uganda, the Federation of Uganda Football Association’s vice-president Florence Nakiwala Kiyingi is also the Minister of Youth and Children Affairs as well as chairperson of Uganda Premier League side Express FC. Tavengwa Mukuhlani “Fifa is very clear on football and politics; it says don’t bring politics into football and vice-versa. You can’t be seen putting on political regalia at a football function or clad in football regalia during a political event. In short, football and politics are like oil and water; they don’t mix, but need each other,” said an observer.
