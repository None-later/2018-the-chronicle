 Editor — The first weekend in August is the National Twins Day. National Twins Day was inspired by a pair of twins, Moses and Aaron Wilcox. In 1819, this pair of identical twins donated 6 acres of land to the town of Millsville, Ohio, on the condition that it change its name to Twinsburg. In 1976, the grateful town of Twinsburg began hosting an annual festival for twins. That year only 36 twins showed up, but today more than 2 000 twins show up at the festival. National Twins Day is a day to celebrate the special bond between twins, whether identical (monozygotic) or fraternal (dizygotic). To form identical twins, one fertilized egg splits and develops two babies with the exact same DNA or genetic information. Here are some fun facts about twins to help you celebrate National Twins Day according to one source: - Identical twins do not have identical fingerprints. - Mirror image identical twins have reverse asymmetric features. About 25 percent of identical twins develop directly facing each other, meaning they become exact reflections of one another. - Tall women are more likely to have twins. - Women who eat a lot of dairy are more prone to conceiving twins.-l Twins interact with each other in the womb. - Some conjoined twins can feel and taste what the other one does. If you are a twin, spend time together. If you don’t live close, connect on the phone or through social media. Be sure to post pictures and memories on social media. The hashtag for National Twins Day is #NationalTwinsDay. Tafadzwa Moyo, Via Email
