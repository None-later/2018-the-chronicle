Madlela Skhobokhobo Mthabisi Tshuma, Gwanda Reporter Madlela Day in Gwanda on Saturday turned out to be the show of the month as more than 2 000 fans thronged Pelandaba Stadium. It was an Easter treat for the fans who joined Madlela in celebrating his success in the music industry in his home town. A first of its kind, the show should in future be dubbed “Fill up Pelandaba” because it showed the potential to fill up the stadium. The show drew people from as far as Bulawayo, Nkayi, Colleen Bawn, Mbalabala and Beitbridge. The show was graced by Gwanda’s, Mayor Clr Knowledge Ndlovu among other officials. Clr Ndlovu urged the fans to enjoy themselves peacefully and it seems fans took heed as the show was violence free. Gwanda up-and-coming artiste Zhezhingtons was among many that gave a sterling performance that kept fans on their feet. Maskandi musician Zinjaziyaluma did not disappoint either and Jeys Marabini showed that like wine, musicians get mature with experience. Man of the moment Madlela Skhobokhobo, showed why he has bagged many awards. Many fans were agreed that it was show of the month saying they have been starved of quality entertainment for a long time. The fans danced until the wee hours of Sunday. The line-up provided a mixed bag although it was largely a traditional music affair. At around 3am, Madlela took it to the stage dressed in his usual crowd puller outfit. He then took revellers through an exhilarating musical journey whose climax was the hit song Ngamnaka usaMamo. Madlela said he was happy to perform before a packed stadium saying this was testimony that local music was growing. “The support through the attendance here clearly shows that people enjoy local music,” he said. @mthabisi_mthire
