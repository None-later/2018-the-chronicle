Fortune Nhliziyo Lynee Kumirayi, Chronicle Reporter A 17-YEAR-OLD pupil from Maphisa who scored 12As and 2Bs at Form Four is appealing for financial assistance to clear his school fees arrears amounting to $1 634 and pay for Advanced Level studies. Fortune Nhliziyo, a pupil at Lower Gwelo Adventist High School in the Midlands province, said he wants to become a chemical engineer but his dreams may be shattered due to financial challenges. Fortune said he had since enrolled for Lower Six at Lower Gwelo Adventist High School as school authorities allowed him to proceed hoping he will get sponsorship to pay for his studies. He said his mother passed away in 2016 and his father is not able to provide the required money. “I wrote 14 subjects and scored 12As and 2Bs and my wish is to complete my A-Levels then proceed to university to further my studies. The challenge that I’m facing is that my family cannot afford to pay for my studies,” he said. “I am a Lower Six sciences student and my desire is to study chemical engineering at university. My mother passed on when I was doing Form Three and since then my family has been struggling financially as she was the one who was paying my school fees.” Mrs Primrose Sibanda, a teacher at the school told The Chronicle that it is their wish to see Fortune further his studies and realise his dream of becoming an engineer as he is an intelligent youngster. Fortune said those willing to assist can contact him on his cell number 0782 537 600 or get in touch with Mrs Sibanda on 0718 966 976. @Lyneesboe
