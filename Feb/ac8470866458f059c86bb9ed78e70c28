Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter DEFENDING Bulawayo Basketball League (BBL) men’s champions Giants are expected to run over Ostrich in this evening’s encounter at Khanyisile Sports Centre. Giants are second on the nine-team table with 14 points, just a point behind table toppers Southern Mavericks. Ostrich are at the bottom of the table, having lost all their matches. Giants are also in action tomorrow when they square off with City Knights in a potential thriller. Giants’ coach Emmanuel Mukandi is confident ahead of the two fixtures. “We have to be at our best in the two games, although we are confident of collecting maximum points. The boys are ready for the matches and confidence levels are high in camp, so we expect to put up brilliant performances on the court. This is the second half of the season we have to make sure that we are not far from the top spot. The goal for us is to successfully defend our title,” said Mukandi. He said his players’ title defence faces stiff opposition from Oilers and Southern Mavericks, who have been playing some impressive basketball this season. In another game scheduled for this evening, undefeated Oilers face Lupane State University as they aim to maintain their unbeaten run. Oilers face Highlanders tomorrow in what should be a tight battle. Ladies’ action is on tomorrow, with Highlanders dating champions Southern Mavericks, while Lakers Junior will battle it out with Angels.
