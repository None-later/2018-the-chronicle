Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter A TSHOLOTSHO businessman has withdrawn a case against 120 villagers who were being prosecuted for public violence and malicious damage to property in a matter arising from a land dispute. Property belonging to the businessman, Mr Owen Sibanda (38) of Dikili village in Shaba area in Ward 16, Tsholotsho was destroyed by the villagers from Ward 13 in Godzo area under chief Magama. Villagers claimed that Mr Sibanda was allocated their grazing land unprocedurally by the Tsholotsho Rural District Council but he won the dispute in court and is already carrying out farming activities on the land. The businessman has since withdrawn charges against the villagers. Mr Sibanda said he decided to withdraw the case against the villagers because he realised they were acting from ignorance. Mr Sibanda’s lawyer, Mr Abednico Ndebele of Mathonsi Ncube Law Chambers confirmed the withdrawal of the case. “I can confirm that my client has withdrawn the case against the 120 villagers who were facing charges of destroying his property. He forgave the villagers whom we believe were allegedly being used by some individuals for political mileage,” he said. @winnie_masara
