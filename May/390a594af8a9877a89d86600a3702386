 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO Athletics Board chairperson Manuel Mpofu says they are wrapping up preparations for the inaugural Old Mutual Nkulumane Half Marathon set for this Sunday. The Nkulumane event was previously a fun run incorporating only the 5km and 10km, but inclusion of the half marathon was aimed at attracting more professional runners. When Old Mutual revived the race in 2014, the event attracted just above 300 participants and the figure has been growing with each edition. The 2017 run attracted a record 1 300 turnout, inspiring Old Mutual to add the half marathon. “We expect a big event this year. We hope to have some of the country’s top athletes taking part,” said Mpofu. Registration fee is $5 for the three events and it closes on Saturday. Entry forms are available at CABS Centre and Old Mutual offices in the city centre as well as at Nkulumane Complex. Independent runner Canicious Nyamutsa won the men’s Old Mutual Nkulumane 10km Fun Run last year to take the $500 prize money. He beat a host of experienced runners, who included Kadoma-based Jacob Mugomeri of Zimpost, who came second and won himself $400, while Misheck Sithole was third. In the women’s category, Bertha Chikanga romped to victory, with Rudo Mhondero finishing second and Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) runner Patience Garauzive beating defending champion Olivia Chitate of ZRP for third place. Old Mutual, who also support big races in South Africa such as the Two Oceans Marathon and the Comrades, also sponsor the Harare marathon, Vumba half marathon, Chitungwiza 10km fun run and Westgate half marathon in Zimbabwe. @innocentskizoe
