 Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter MATABELELAND South province is set to market its destination through a provincial video that will be shown at their stand at the forthcoming Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF). The promotional video will showcase the seven districts of the rainbow province as well as the culture and talent of the people of Matabeleland South who include the Venda, Kalanga, Shangani, San and Sotho among others. All the activities provided in the province, lodges, safaris and the traditional foods which include the famous amacimbi are all featured in the video. The minerals which include gold, cement which is largely extracted in Colleen Bawn and mountains scattered all over the province with Matobo topping the list are also there. The province is home to some of the biggest rivers and dams in the country which extend their support to other provinces – all these are captured. Not to be left out are the province’s busiest entry points that include Beitbridge Border Post and Plumtree Border Post. A glimpse of these ports’ day to day activities will be shown as a way to give those who have never visited the province, a glimpse of the area. Through this video, it is hoped that the province will attract more tourists and investors in order to boost the province and the nation at large. @mthabisi_mthire
