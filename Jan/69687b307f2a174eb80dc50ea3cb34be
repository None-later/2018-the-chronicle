 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter Southern Mavericks shot to the top of the Bulawayo Basketball League men’s table after winning two of their weekend games. Mavericks first cruised to a 106-32 win over struggling Ostrich before seeing off City Knights 68-25 in their second game. Mthokozisi Sibanda top-scored in the first encounter with 21 points while Nhlanhla Chirinda grabbed 19 points to help Mavericks overtake Oilers and go top with 14 points from eight games. However, Oilers, who were inactive at the weekend, should not be worried as they have played two games less than the log leaders. Ostrich lost their second game of the weekend when they were pipped 37-38 by Nust B. The defeats left Ostrich rooted at the bottom of the table with just five points from five games. Defending champions Giants beat Lupane State University (LSU) 79-27, with Norman Chimukanda grabbing an impressive 23 points. Giants moved into third place on the table with 12 points from seven games, just two points adrift Mavericks. There was just one encounter in the women’s category in which Angels dismissed LSU 58-18. Results Men: Mavericks 106-32 Ostrich, Giants 79-27 LSU, NUST B 38-37 Ostrich, Mavericks 68-25 City Knights Women: Angels 58-18.
