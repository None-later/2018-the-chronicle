Paul Zakariya Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls THE Zimbabwe Farmers’ Union (ZFU) this week plays host to a regional farmers’ conference here with representatives from 13 countries expected to participate. The meeting starts today with a focus on enhancing agricultural trade, ZFU executive director, Mr Paul Zakariya, said. “The conference begins on Monday and the regional organisation will have its annual general meeting on Wednesday. This is the Southern African Confederation of Agricultural Unions whose hosting is rotational and the theme will be on how trade can enhance agricultural production,” said Mr Zakariya. He said agricultural experts from the Sadc region attending the conference are expected to tackle issues to do with quality, production and market threshold. Mr Zakariya said the country’s agricultural sector was always open for business. “There will be 13 countries and ZFU is a member of the regional confederation hence it is participating at the conference as an official delegate. “We are happy that Government says it is open to business and what is left is to put in place policies that will enhance the open for business mantra,” said Mr Zakariya. He said the mantra should translate into policy environment that allows viable agricultural business. “The policy should help farmers access finance, security of tenure, prevent farm invasions and do away with punitive taxation that discourages production,” he said. @ncubeleon
