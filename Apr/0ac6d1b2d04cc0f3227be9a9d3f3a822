The Chevrons Harare Bureau ZIMBABWE will need to make the most of the triangular series involving Pakistan and Australia if they hope to get an automatic place at the ICC World T20 to be hosted by Australia. Currently, the Chevrons are not guaranteed a berth and would need to go through a qualifying process if they finish the year outside the top 10 on the rankings. The national team are currently trapped on 12th place behind Scotland and number 10 side Bangladesh. Zimbabwe are scheduled to host the current top two teams, Pakistan and Australia, from June 28-July 8 with wins guaranteeing them good points to cover some ground. The ICC World T20 2020 will take place in Australia between October 18 and November 15 in 2020. And, according to ICCâ€™s new qualifying format, the top 10 teams from the MRF Tyres ICC T20I Team Rankings as at December 31, will get automatic berths at the finals of the tournament. Six teams that took part at the previous World T20 edition but are out of the top 10 by the December 31 deadline will have to play in the ICC World T20 Qualifier, alongside the eight qualifiers from the regional finals. The venue of the Qualifier is yet to be announced.
