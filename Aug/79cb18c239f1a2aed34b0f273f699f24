Marshall Jonga Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter HARARE businessman Marshall Jonga was yesterday elected the new chairperson of Zimbabwe Beach Soccer after resoundingly beating incumbent Joseph Musariri. The elections, held at a Harare hotel, saw Jonga getting eight votes from the nine ballots cast, while three members of the electoral college did not participate in the election process. “Marshall Zvikomborero Jonga duly elected Beach Soccer chairperson ahead of Joseph Musariri. Jonga polled eight out of the nine ballots cast. Three members of the electoral college did not vote due to several reasons,” said Zifa in a statement yesterday. Musariri failed in his bid to convince the electorate that he deserved another term to turn around Beach Soccer beyond the seven years in which he has been at the helm and virtually nothing has happened. The veteran administrator did himself a disfavour when earlier this week he made a futile attempt to suspend Jonga from the poll. That bid to suspend Jonga was quashed by Zifa, which clarified that the build-up to the polls was being administered by the electoral committee, which verified the eligibility of the candidates and the electoral college. As the countdown to the ultimate elections in which the Zifa executive committee will be elected into office on December 1 continues, the next elections will be for the PSL that will be held on September 9 and those for various provincial chairpersons, according to the Zifa elections roadmap.
