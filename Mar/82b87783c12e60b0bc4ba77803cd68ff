 Codelia Mondela, Court Reporter A 31-YEAR-OLD man from Nkayi allegedly raped a woman twice his age and stole her cellphone. Sindiso Makaza, a court heard yesterday, went to the elderly woman (63)’s homestead and pleaded with her to open the door on Boxing Day last year. When she opened it, Makaza allegedly dragged her outside and raped her on the muddy ground. He pleaded not guilty to rape charges before Bulawayo regional magistrate Mr Trynose Utahwashe who remanded him in custody to next Tuesday for trial. For the State, Mr Robin Mukura alleged that Makaza raped the woman at her homestead on December 26 last year. He said Makaza knocked on the woman’s doorstep at around 1 AM. “The woman asked what he wanted during that time of the night and asked him to identify himself. She opened the door and upon entering the house, Makaza dragged her outside and took away her cellphone,” he said. “The woman tried to scream but he overpowered her, forced the old woman to lie on the ground and raped her.” The court heard that Makaza fled after he saw a person approaching carrying a torch. Mr Mukura said villagers searched for him and he was arrested at his grandfather’s homestead a few days later. Makaza agreed to return the elderly woman’s cellphone which he had hidden in the bush near his kraal. @MondelaC
