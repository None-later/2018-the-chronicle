Mr David Coltart Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent MDC politician Mr David Coltart has written to the principals of the MDC Alliance requesting that he runs for senate elections instead of a parliamentary seat. Mr Coltart (pictured above) was set to contest in Bulawayo East constituency where he was beaten by Ms Thabitha Khumalo (MDC-T) in the last elections. In an interview yesterday, Mr Coltart said he took the decision after consulting his family and law firm. He said his family advised him to vie for the senatorial seat instead of being actively involved in constituency development. “And my family and my law firm would rather that I stand in the Senate. The precise reason behind it is that senators do more of law making than running a constituency. And that is the thinking behind it and that is my role as a lawyer,” he said. Mr Coltart said he remains committed to the MDC Alliance and was hoping that his request will be acceded to. Ms Khumalo said she was not aware of the latest development. However, sources in the MDC-T said Mr Coltart’s exit could see her bouncing back to contest the Bulawayo East constituency. Mr Coltart is not the first seasoned politician to quit contesting for a Lower House seat. Zanu-PF secretary for administration Cde Obert Mpofu and long standing MP for Umguza Constituency also migrated to contest for the senate. Cde Mpofu who is also the Minister of Home Affairs and Culture said he was quitting the National Assembly seat to pave way for younger blood. “I am now old, I now want to sit with elders in the Senate. There is a young leader that I have identified and groomed. There is a need for older people to train and lead the youths to prepare for the future. A position should not belong to one person but should be passed on to others,” said Dr Mpofu. Matabeleland North provincial chairperson Cde Richard Moyo is now contesting for the Umguza Constituency National Assembly seat.—@nqotshili.
