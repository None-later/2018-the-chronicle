Doctors perform free eye cataract operation on patients at Richard Morris Hospital in Bulawayo Whatsaap After receiving a text message that Richard Morris would be having an eye camp from 15 to 17 August 2018 I went to the hospital last Friday to confirm if this was true and as a pensioner, I was eager to have a free cataract removal. I was told this was so but advised to be there early as a large crowd was expected. I went to the hospital at 8.00PM with a relative on 14 August to join the queue early but only to be told 13 hours later by an official of the hospital that they had met challenges with the donors. This came as a shock to be told in the 11th hour. Some people could be heard grumbling that they had hired transport all way from Beitbridge. The hospital should have advised us through the radio and TV that the eye camp was off. — Ndabitshekile Hillside. Bulawayo. Legal measures should be taken against Gweru City Council. Residents in Mkoba are dying of typhoid. Nothing so far has been put in place to solve the problem. People are now buying bottled water from supermarkets. Government should intervene in Mkoba. — Worried Resident, Mkoba 19 Is it possible for the Constitutional Court to speed up the ruling? I am anxiously waiting for President Mnangagwa’s inauguration. There is so much work for him to do after. The MDC Alliance is wasting time. – Gura. Twitter I think the reason Chamisa filed his papers to challenge ED’s victory at the last hour was just to delay President Mnangagwa’s inauguration.— @OnwellOnnie
