FORMER Highlanders player and manager Lawrence Phiri (third from left) Allen Khumalo, Sports Reporter THE inaugural Highlanders Half Marathon and wheelchair race scheduled for Saturday has been postponed to a date yet to be announced. Highlanders Athletics Club interim chairperson and facilitator of the inaugural half marathon Lawrence Phiri said the postponement was due to logistical challenges. “We regret to inform that we have postponed the Highlanders Half Marathon that was scheduled to take place on September 1, 2018. This has been necessitated by logistical challenges. After consultation with the Bulawayo Athletics Board, we decided to move the race to an unconfirmed date,” said Phiri. The half marathon was aimed at raising funds for the Cancer Association of Zimbabwe and Highlanders Football Club, with part of the money being channelled at sustaining the athletics club. Phiri said efforts would be made to ensure the race takes place as soon as possible. “We would like to apologise to our stakeholders and athletes who had been looking forward to the race in various capacities. Athletes that had already registered for the race will be contacted personally,” Phiri said. @khumzallen
