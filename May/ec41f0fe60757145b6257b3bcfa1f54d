Sukoluhle Ndlovu, Midlands Correspondent ZANU-PF in Midlands province has thrown its weight behind candidates that won in the primary elections last month. In an interview, Zanu-PF Midlands chairman Engineer Daniel Mackenzie Ncube said the party is now rallying behind the candidates that will represent the party in the harmonised elections slated for July. “As a party we have come together to support and campaign for the candidates that will be contesting in the forthcoming elections. Our target is to make sure that we win most seats in the province so unity is the only way forward,” he said. Eng Ncube said although there were complaints from some sections concerning the elections, everyone has accepted the outcome and moved on. “Yes there were complaints about the outcome of the elections, but everyone in the province accepted the outcome and moved on. As a province we are now focusing on campaigning for the candidates who will represent our party in the forthcoming elections,” he said. Eng Ncube encouraged Zanu-PF supporters in the province to vote for President Emmerson Mnangagwa saying he will deliver on his promises. “I also like to urge people from the province to vote for President Mnangagwa because he is capable of delivering. Since he assumed office in November last year, he has made tremendous changes to the country’s economy. “He has managed to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from a number of investors through his ‘Zimbabwe is open for business’ mantra,” he said. Of the 29 candidates, only 11 were re-elected while the rest fell by the way side after the primary elections. The party recently launched election campaigns in the eight districts where candidates were introduced to members.
