 Cape Town — Liverpool have hired the Guinness World Record holder for the longest throw, Thomas Gronnemark, to help improve their set-play deliveries. The Danish coach, who has previously spent time working with Schalke, Hertha Berlin in Germany and FC Midtjylland in Denmark, has joined the Reds on a part-time basis. Last season he helped Midtjylland progress to the Play-off round of the Europa League, with the club having exploited their enhanced ability from throw-ins. Gronnemark holds the world record for the longest throw-in at 51.33m. Speaking after his appointment, the newest Red said: “Midtjylland showed that the long throw-in can be a weapon, if you can do it with the correct technique, precision and tactical awareness. “It’s very important that it’s a flat throw, because if it’s too high it’s easy to defend. “If you can make a long throw-in precise and flat, together with some tactical aspects, then it’s much easier to score.” — Sport24.
