 Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter THERE is tension between parents of a four-year-old girl from Lupane who died after being attacked by her nine-year-old sister and a Grade One neighbour. The pair tied the now deceased’s hands and legs with strips of bark (ingxoza) before stuffing sand into her mouth to stop her from screaming and beat her up with a stick. A police source said according to results of a post- mortem that was conducted at United Bulawayo Hospitals, the girl was choked by the sand that blocked her throat as well as nostrils. Family sources have revealed that the parents (names withheld for ethical reasons), who are both based in South Africa, separated late last year. The mother decided to bring the now deceased to her parent’s home in Zimbabwe. “The father was against this, saying the mother wanted to be mischievous that is why she was sending away their child. The father wanted his daughter to attend school in South Africa since she was born there. The mother went against his word and sent the child back home to her parents in November,” said a family member who preferred not to be named. The father and the deceased’s mother both come from Lupane but different villages. In a telephone interview, the siblings’ mother told The Chronicle that although she had buried her daughter, she still could not believe what happened. “When I received the news I couldn’t believe it. I didn’t even cry until when we arrived home and I saw her coffin. The most difficult part now is for me to accept that my own child could kill her sister,” she said. She said she had not spoken to her daughter to find out what pushed her to commit the crime. “All I want to know now is why the Lord has punished me in such a way because my daughter seems unaware of the pain she has caused everyone here,” she said. The girl died on Monday last week after she was assaulted by her sister and the Grade One neighbour who also stuffed sand into her mouth.— @winnie_masara
