THE Matabeleland Amateur Swimming Board (MASB) has selected a 70-member squad for the national championships to be staged in Harare from January 2-6. Those called up excelled in the Matabeleland Swimming Championships held at the Bulawayo City Pool last week. Seventeen boys and eight girls will represent the province in the 12 years and under category, while the 13-14-year age group is made up of nine boys and 12 girls. The 15-16-year category is made up of nine boys and five girls, while nine boys and one girl will represent the province in the 17 years and over category. Matabeleland came second in last year’s National Swimming Championships and will be hoping for better fortunes in this year’s edition. Last year’s national competition was won by Mashonaland, who dominated both the boys’ and girls’ events to amass a whooping 2 957 points compared to Matabeleland’s 2 074. Mashonaland Country Districts were a distant third with 190 points.
