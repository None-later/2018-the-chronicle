As the Coca-Cola Company, we say we will continue supporting talent development. Our existence is because of people who support us and what better way to support talent from grassroots level other than such initiatives. “This year’s edition should be bigger and better. We hope all schools will participate with the zeal to be part of the celebrations of this milestone. We want talent to be identified and players discovered to go on and realise their full potential.” Objectives of the COPA Coca-Cola tournament include inspiring young footballers to achieve their dreams through the competition by providing a global platform, camaraderie and opportunity for talented individuals to showcase their talent.
