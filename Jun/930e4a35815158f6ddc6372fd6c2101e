Chinhoyi7 Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent Movie enthusiasts in Bulawayo will have to rush to watch war biopic, Chinhoyi 7 which will start being screened in the city as from this Friday at Ster Kinekor cinemas. A week after it premiered in Harare at the Ster Kinekor cinemas at Sam Levy where the venue was oversubscribed, Bulawayo movie enthusiasts will finally have a chance to watch the much-hyped movie.

Ster Kinekor Bulawayo spokesperson Maybe Simbisai called on people to come in their numbers for the screening. “We’re excited to be screening Chinhoyi 7 in Bulawayo. This is after its successful premiere in Harare last week. So people should come in their numbers this Friday so that they watch the local movie,” said Simbisai. She said they expect the movie to be on their Cinema 3 silver screen for the next two weeks. The movie that was commissioned by former Zimbabwe Defence Forces Commander and now Vice-President of Zimbabwe General Constantino Chiwenga (Rtd) is based on true events about seven liberation war fighters David Guzuzu, Arthur Maramba, Christopher Chatambudza, Simon Chingosha Nyandoro, Godfrey Manyerenyere, Godwin Dube and Chubby Savanhu. It was produced by United Kingdom-based Tawanda Sarireni. Meanwhile, the Girlfriends Getaway has been pencilled for next Thursday starting at 6:30PM with the movie of the night being Oceans 8.
