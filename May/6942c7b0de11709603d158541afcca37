 Codelia Mondela, Court Reporter A 29-YEAR-OLD man from Douglasdale in Bulawayo allegedly waylaid and raped his 52-year-old neighbour who was coming from a local bottle store. The man, a court heard yesterday, approached the woman from behind while calling out her child’s name. He tripped the woman and allegedly raped her once. He was not asked to plead to rape charges when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Adelaide Mbeure who remanded the matter to June 4. She advised him to apply for bail at the High Court. Prosecuting, Mr Tawurai Hondoyemoto alleged that the man ambushed his neighbour last Friday at around 8PM when she was walking alone from Jiri Bottle Store. “While she was in a bushy area inside Doves plot, the man came from behind and tripped her. She fell to the ground and the man dragged her by the arm while calling her by her child’s name,” he said. “After being raped, the woman tried to stop him from leaving while alerting the neighbours, but he fled.” It was not stated in court how the man was arrested. @MondelaC
