A BULAWAYO-based organisation, Youth With Destiny (YWD), in conjunction with the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation as well as Organisation of Rural Associations for Progress (Orap) hosted a traditional games festival at Chakwana ground in Cowdray Park on Saturday. The festival was run under the theme “Closing the Gap between Information and the Community”. Cowdray Park residents took part in various indigenous games, which included intsoro, umamtshayana, ingwini and pada, among others. YWD chairperson Sakhile Dube said the aim of the festival was to help citizens socialise and compete, while the youths got an opportunity to network and share life skills and ideas. “We had invited various stakeholders, who include the National Aids Council, ORAP and other companies from Bulawayo to come and promote their services as well as to take social corporate responsibility to the people of Cowdray Park. “We chose traditional games to remind people of their African roots and the fact that playing games also helps keep youths from drug abuse as meeting publicly does away with such practices,” said Dube. YWD is a youth-led non-profit organisation formed in 2015 with the aim of empowering young people with life skills education, assistance with crash courses for examinations as well as linking youths to entrepreneurial opportunities. The association also seeks to encourage youths to be active and responsible citizens in their respective communities. Since its formation, the association has held several community activities, which include clean-up campaigns, orphanage visit and health awareness programmes. — @khumzallen.
