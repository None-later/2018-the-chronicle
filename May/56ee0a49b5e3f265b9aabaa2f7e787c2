Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) will hold a training workshop aimed at empowering sports administrators in Bulawayo at Eveline High School from May 26-27. SRC Bulawayo provincial coordinator Sam Dzvimbu encouraged sports administrators to register for what he called an important course. “This is more of a refresher course for administrators to keep up with changing trends that affect the sports industry. The level of development in sport and recreation is directly linked to skills, technical and administrative competences endowed within the system. Courses such as this one ensure that there is smooth governance in sport associations,” said Dzvimbu. “It is of great importance that we have relevant knowledge imparted to those in top positions in sporting circles. Registration for the course is open at the SRC offices at Khumalo Hockey Stadium and closes on May 25. Our target is to have a 100 participants for the course. We invite physical education teachers, sport directors, administrators, sport associations, club executives, heads in charge of various sport codes in schools and colleges, past sportspersons, legends and all those aspiring to be in sports administration to register for this important programme.” Dzvimbu said courses of this nature actively help promote the development of Zimbabwean sport practitioners to positions of influence in regional, continental and international federations.
