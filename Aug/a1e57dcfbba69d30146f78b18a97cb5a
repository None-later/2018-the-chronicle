Mandla da Comedian Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent WINNING two awards in a year is like living a dream for comedian Mandlenkosi Simbarashe Mathe. At 23, Mandla da Comedian, as Mathe is known, has won the 2018 National   Art Merit Award and the Roil Bulawayo Arts Award for being the most outstanding comedian. To celebrate these achievements, he has organised a one-man show dubbed Am I Dreaming? that will be held at the Bulawayo Theatre tomorrow. He hopes to fill the near 300-seater venue where he will showcase his talent on the mic and has called on the services of two of the city’s artistes Cal_Vin and Msiz’Kay. Entrance has been pegged at $5 for advance tickets and $6 at the door. VIP tickets will be sold for $10. Mandla da Comedian said the show was a celebration of his two awards as well as his flourishing career. “The awards that I’ve won are really a dream come true for an artiste like me. This is why I decided to host this show to celebrate with those who’ve been supporting me,” he said. “Preparations for the event are going along well with advance tickets selling steadily.” The comedian said he had themed the event Am I Dreaming? as his achievements were unbelievable. “Am I Dreaming is me questioning what’s happened, the good and bad in my career. I’ll be revisiting the things I’ve acquired through being an artiste and a household name,” said Mandla da Comedian. He said after the show tomorrow, he will focus on taking his act to international stages and venturing into acting. “I want to perform at international gigs and festivals in order to make my brand visible outside the country’s borders. I also have a passion for acting and I’m looking for a way to break into that sector. “The acting dream is very big and I hope it gets fulfilled.”
