The late Dr Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo Pamela Shumba, Senior Reporter THE Joshua Nkomo Cultural Movement (JNCM) has urged Zimbabweans to preserve the late Vice President Dr Joshua Nkomo’s legacy as the country commemorates his life and prepares for the harmonised elections to be held month end.  Yesterday marked 19 years following Dr Nkomo’s death. Dr Nkomo, who was affectionately known as Father Zimbabwe, died in 1999 after a lifetime of personal sacrifice and selfless service to the people. JNCM chairman and son to Dr Nkomo, Mr Sibangilizwe Nkomo, said his father was a selfless and patriotic leader who will always be remembered for his love for peace. “This is a significant month for us because we’re celebrating the life of one of our national heroes and freedom fighters while we’re also preparing for our elections. As we remember Dr Nkomo, it’s my wish that the people of Zimbabwe also remember to preserve his legacy by making sure that peace prevails in the country during elections,” said Mr Nkomo in an interview yesterday. He said the organisation decided to take this year’s celebrations to remember Dr Nkomo to Harare, where a memorial lecture was held at the University of Zimbabwe (UZ) on Thursday to introspect as people remember the late national hero. “Over the years, we’ve been hosting Dr Nkomo’s celebrations in Matabeleland in memory of Dr Nkomo, but this year we decided to have a lecture at UZ as part of the Dr Nkomo centenary celebrations. “Since Dr Nkomo was a national leader, it’s important for us to rotate the celebrations so that his legacy is spread to all parts of the country,” said Mr Nkomo. He said Dr Nkomo left a void that will be difficult to fill as the country still misses him 19 years after his death. “We still miss him and we’ll continue to celebrate his life. His legacy will not die because Dr Nkomo was a true father who stood for humanity and had strong values that united the people of Zimbabwe,” said Mr Nkomo. @pamelashumba1
