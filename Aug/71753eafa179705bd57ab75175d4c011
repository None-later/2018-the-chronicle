 Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter A concert aimed at creating exposure for up-and-coming Bulawayo Hip Hop musicians has been organised and is expected to take place on August 11 at Rainbow Elite cinema. Gardner Chisoro, one of the organisers of the event said the concert dubbed the “Annual August Rush” is aimed at creating exposure for up-and-coming artistes. “There’re so many talented artistes who’re not receiving airplay from local radio stations. These are the people whose careers we want to boost through this concert,” Chisoro said. Some of the artistes that will be performing include Mambo hit-maker Asaph, K Brizzy and M.U.S.E. “It’s not been easy putting this event together. I hope that people will come in their numbers and support the great talent Bulawayo has to offer,” said Chisoro. Tickets are already being sold with general ones pegged at $2 and VIP tickets $5. Chisoro said there would be a meet and greet session as well as photo shoot and snacks provided for the VIPs. He added that he hopes the concert will grow as they want it to be an annual event. “We hope this show will reach its full potential and start attracting sponsors so that we can host it annually.”
