David Grewe Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter UNITED States-based David Grewe has urged local athletes to take exercising more seriously as it contributes to a more efficient heart and lung function which is of importance for any sporting person. Grewe was speaking during a public lecture address at the National University of Science and Technology (Nust) yesterday. The address was on the topics of physiology of the heart, circulation and metabolism in relation to sport. Grewe, who is a specialist on the topics and a visiting lecturer at Nust, addressed students, athletes, coaches, health advisors and sport practitioners from the city. “It is very important for someone in sport to have an understanding of these topics, they help one perform better and keep a healthy body. It is important for athletes to understand their own body, this includes athletes watching what they eat and how they exercise. Exercising regularly through sports programmes helps in ensuring that athletes reach their full potential in their different sporting disciplines. My advice to the athletes is that they should not underestimate the importance of regular exercise,” said Grewe. Sipho Rutsate, chairperson in the Department of Sports Science and Coaching, said the address had been informative. “We hardly get specialists who come in to address us. This was a very informative lecture, this was really important because we got to learn about how the machine which is the heart gets to function. The lecture also helped in understanding the body recovery process, how to train the body properly amongst other important aspects of maintaining a healthy sporting body,” she said. The public lecture was facilitated by the Department of Sports Science and Coaching at the university.
