 Lovemore Zigara in Gweru VUMBACHIKWE registered their second win of the season by beating Sheasham 1–0 in a Zimbabwe General Medical Aid Fund Central Soccer League match in Gwanda at the weekend. Munyaradzi Takaendesa struck the winning goal in the fifth minute to secure maximum points for the home side and end Sheasham’s five-match unbeaten run. This leaves army side Tongogara as the only unbeaten side in the CSL. Vumbachikwe coach Angirai Chapo said the win was a morale booster for his side and hopes to finish in the top four at the end of the season. “We are improving as a team and we hope to keep the momentum. We want to move away from the relegation zone and hope for a top four finish at the end of the season,” said Chapo. Sheasham coach Jeremiah Neganda was disappointed with the loss and said they would have to pick up the pieces ahead of their next assignment. “It is disappointing that we lost this game, which I felt we could have won, as we controlled the match for the better part. “However, it is water under the bridge now and we look forward to the next assignment at home. “We have to believe in ourselves and be positive in our next assignment,” Neganda said.
