 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter NEWLY promoted Zifa Southern Region Division One league side Toronto received a shot in the arm ahead of their maiden season in the second tier after prominent gynaecologist, Dr Solwayo Ngwenya, pledged to sponsor the club. Ngwenya will cater for the team’s travelling expenses, stadium rentals, affiliation fees, referees fees and equipment, among others. “What this project (Toronto) seeks to achieve is to give promising youngsters an opportunity to play in the First Division and even go on to play in the Premiership. “So after these boys got promoted they have been struggling to meet the required funds for them to take part in the league, so l had to step in and assist the team financially. Through this team, we will be playing our part in talent development and taking boys off the streets. We hope this gives the club owners hope to continue with this project. Hopefully, we have other people coming in to support their ambitious project,” said Ngwenya. Toronto co-director Ghetto Nkala was ecstatic about the timely boost. “We’re excited about this gesture. It is such support which gives us the will to keep supporting sport and ensure that our talented youngsters can shape and improve their football talents. We’re not going into this league to fulfil matches, but to compete. Let the games begin,” said Nkala. Toronto begin their campaign away to Mosi Rovers in Victoria Falls this weekend.
