 Elita Chikwati, Harare Bureau The Grain Millers’ Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ) has petitioned Government to stop maize and wheat bran imports as this is threatening the viability of the local milling industry. Bran is the by-product realised after the milling of wheat, maize and other grains, and is used in the manufacture of stock feeds. In a letter addressed to Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement Minister Air Chief Marshal Perrance Shiri (Retired), GMAZ general manager, Ms Lynette Veremu, said the milling industry was concerned by the continued issuance of import permits for maize and wheat brans. “There is now a glut of these imports across the country, especially in areas such as Matabeleland North, Matabeleland South and Bulawayo region,” she said. “These imports have disrupted the milling ecosystem as local millers are now unable to dispose their by-products, making it difficult to continue milling viably.” Ms Veremu said millers were stuck with 11 650 tonnes of maize and wheat bran against a national requirement 3 700 metric tonnes. “We appeal to your office to withdraw all import permits and possibly position officers at the borders,” she said. “Grain Millers’ Association of Zimbabwe offers to pay allowances and travel costs of these officers.” GMAZ last year bought 800 000 tonnes of maize which was produced under Command Agriculture. The organisation also bought the same amount of wheat. Last month, GMAZ also pledged to buy 10 000 tonnes of damaged wheat and 50 000 tonnes of soyabeans whose by-products would also run out of market should Government continue to issue bran import permits, she said.
