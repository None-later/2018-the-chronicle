A burning hut Nothabo Nyathi, Chronicle Reporter A FAMILY of five including an 82-year-old woman cheated death when an unknown person set their bedroom hut on fire and locked the door from outside. Ms Judith Hadebe’s family from Ndimakule Village in Jambezi under Chief Shana escaped death after an unknown person set fire on the hut they were sleeping in. The Chronicle news crew who visited the scene heard that Ms Hadebe (60) was sleeping in the hut with her 82-year-old mother and three minor children when the incident occurred. Ms Hadebe said they reported the matter to the police. “After hearing sounds of burning grass, I woke up only to be shocked that the roof was on fire. I couldn’t think of what could have caused the fire as we do not use candles but solar light. “I managed to wake up my mother and the children who were deeply asleep. The problem was the door, I was struggling to open the door as someone had locked it from the outside,” said Ms Hadebe. The family broke down the door and escaped before the fire had spread. “When I finally managed to open the door, we all got out safely. I thought of the birth certificates of the children and I rushed to retrieve them. I attempted to pull out the bags of maize to no avail, it all got burnt,” said Ms Hadebe. “Inside the hut we had stored all valuable things both property and food as it was the biggest hut. We had sofas, chairs, wardrobe, bed, cupboard, maize and food comprising of basic commodities which was all reduced to ashes. “The children have since failed to go to school as their uniforms got burnt. We are at zero, we lost everything.” Hwange West MP Mr Bekithemba Mpofu visited the Hadebe family on Monday. “We heard of the misfortune that has befallen the family and I believe the police will soon arrest the person behind this,” said Mr Mpofu. The person who locked the hut before setting it ablaze is still unknown. Police could not immediately comment on the matter. @nyathi_nothabo
