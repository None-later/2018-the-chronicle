First Lady Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa Tendai Rupapa in Bulawayo Women in Bulawayo on Thursday thronged Mpilo Central Hospital for cancer screening a day after the First Lady Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa got screened at the United Bulawayo Hospital (UBH) for the same. The First Lady was screened for cervical and breast cancer on Wednesday, opening the floodgates. Natasha Nyoni (25) of Mzilikazi said she felt encouraged by the First Lady. “Considering her position as the country’s First Lady, she could have just encouraged women to get screened by just talking, but she had to lead by example at a public hospital and got screened,” she said. “So, I asked myself, why can I not do the same, hence the decision I made today to get checked.” Nomonde Nkomo (18) of Makokoba also got screened for cancer. “A neighbour, aunt Siphile, told us about the First Lady’s visit and that she had been screened at UBH,” she said. “She told us the First Lady brought a mobile clinic and women were being screened for free. “I experience severe pains during my menstrual period and I do not know what is causing the pains hence the need for me to get screened for cervical cancer as well. I also informed my four friends of the good news and they are also here to get screened.” Siphathweyinkosi Moyo (33) also applauded the First Lady for taking the lead in the fight against cervical and breast cancer. “I want to thank the First Lady for taking the first step and now we are following in her footsteps,” she said. “We are also here for cervical and breast cancer screening. “I do not feel any pains, but I decided to get checked early because they say cervical and breast cancer can be treated if detected early.” The First Lady was screened at the UBH as a way of motivating women to fight cancer. The country has intensified the war against the silent killer disease in recent years.
