RAPPER Cal_Vin has decided to take his Made in Bulawayo (MIB) Concert to his Luveve neighbourhood as a way to interact with and inspire youths there. For the first time, the show, which is now in its third edition, will move from the city centre and be held at Luveve Beit Hall this Saturday. That Luveve Boy, as Cal_Vin is known, said the concert would be a mixture of hip hop and afro soul with performances from Mawiza, GTI, Mzoe 7, Purple, Msiz’Kay, Luchi Shiki, CMK, Rockie Doub, Cliff Jeans, Luminous, MJ Sings, T1nda, K.Tox, Tey Blondie and Tebza. The musician, who released an album Nhliziyo last month, said although he had a significant following in his neighbourhood, he had not held a show there ever since he burst onto the music scene. The best he did was to shoot a music video for his hit Zikhuphan’ there. “This year, I want to take the concert to the place where my story started — ekasi lami (in my neighbourhood). I’ve a large following there that unfortunately hasn’t had the opportunity to see me perform live as most of my events have been in town,” said That Luveve Boy. “From now onwards, I’ll be holding the Made in Bulawayo Concert in the ghetto so as to inspire young people there.” Last year, the MIB Concert was held at Elite 400 where it was bedevilled by poor organisation and sound that disappointed the around 400 fans who attended. For this year’s event, Cal_Vin said he has put enough contingencies and roped in the likes of DJ Mzoe and Saimon Mambazo for sound and lighting. The holding of this concert will mean that Cal_Vin will be missing the Zim Hip Hop awards being held at Pablo’z VIP Club in Harare on Saturday where he is nominated in one category (Hip Hop Personality of the Year).
