CAPS United-bound former Highlanders vice captain Gabriel Nyoni last week donated his black and white playing top to a disabled Highlanders supporter Melusi Khumalo as a token of appreciation for his support. Khumalo who never misses Bosso’s games even training sessions is wheelchair bound but is always present at the team’s sessions as well as the club house after hours to mix and mingle with other Highlanders fans. “He came to all our training sessions. He attended all our home games. I really had to thank him with my jersey for his unwavering support so that he continues to support the remaining & future Bosso stars. “You are not invisible my man we see you and we appreciate your support. I will keep at heart the words you told me today,” Nyoni posted on his Facebook account. Khumalo was naturally grateful for the gesture but refused to reveal what he told the former vice captain. “I am thankful for the gift by Gabriel, even though it’s sad that he leaves us, I wish him all the best wherever he goes and hope that one day he will rejoin this great institution called Highlanders,” said Khumalo.
