 Lisa Mangena, Court Reporter AN 18-YEAR-OLD maid from Bulawayo allegedly forced her employer’s seven-year-old son to have sex with her and infected him with gonorrhoea. Sometime in July, Annet Mpala went to the minor’s room where he was sleeping. She took off the boy’s clothes and put him on top of her and allegedly had sexual intercourse with him without his consent. Mpala pleaded guilty to aggravated indecent assault before Bulawayo Magistrate Ms Sibonginkosi Mkandla who remanded her in custody to today. Prosecuting, Ms Paida Zengeni told the court that it was not the first time Mpala had slept with the minor. The court heard the minor started feeling pain when urinating. “The child told his mother that he was feeling some pain when urinating but she thought it was just a minor issue and gave him paracetamol,” said Ms Zengeni. “Early in August, the minor told his mother that he noticed some discharge on his private parts. She took her child to the bedroom where she examined him and noticed pus on his underwear. The complainant’s mother asked her son what had happened. She was told that the maid had slept with her son”. She asked the maid if the minor was telling the truth and she admitted she had sex with him. The minor was taken to Mpilo Central Hospital and upon examination, the doctors said he could have contracted gonorrhoea. The mother proceeded to Queenspark Police Station and filed a report leading to Mpala’s arrest. @LissahMangena
