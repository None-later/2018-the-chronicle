Mavis Kolsek Sukoluhle Ndlovu, Midlands Correspondent THE stage is set for the Miss Tourism Zimbabwe Midlands pageant taking place at the Cathedral Hall in Gweru tonight. Fifteen beauties from Gokwe, Gweru, Kwekwe, Redcliff and Zvishavane will battle it out on the ramp at the contest being run under the theme: ‘Unveiling the beauty of Zimbabwe’. Miss Tourism Midlands co-ordinator Mavis Koslek said the pageant, a precursor to Miss Tourism Zimbabwe, was meant to nurture talent among young girls and teach them to be their own voices. She said through the pageant, they would harness up-and-coming talent and enable the models to discover their beauty and its purpose as well as equip them with tools to make an impact in the country. “The aim of this pageant is to empower the girl child and nurture talent that these girls have. We also want to teach them to stand up and fight abuse in their communities. They were also taught about women empowerment and their rights as women,” Koslek said. Competition, Koslek said, is expected to be stiff as they want to select the best from the province. The girl who will be crowned queen and her first princess will go on to represent the Midlands province at the national contest being held in Bulawayo on September 8. The Travellers Band, Legion, Xiddo, DJ Raza, DJ Mupsy, B-Hood, and Brickcity will provide entertainment. – @sukusinini.
