FARMERS have been urged to brace for a dry season in the face of an El Nino-induced drought. Masvingo crop and livestock provincial officer Mr Peter Chamisa said farmers should plant short season varieties as the country is expected to record below normal to normal rainfall. He said those who plant small grains are likely to harvest despite the El Nino induced drought. “Farmers may start planting now if they have prepared the land. The rains being received in different parts of the country signal the start of the rainy season,” said Mr Chamisa. He said farmers that have water for irrigation should irrigate their crops during the dry spell. “Due to the unpredictability of the rainy season as announced by the department of meteorology, farmers might be forced to replant,” said Mr Chamisa. — @walterbmswazie 2
