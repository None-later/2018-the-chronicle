 Sylvester Chiramba, Court Reporter A MOTORIST from Bulawayo, who hit and dragged a pedestrian for 16 metres before fleeing from the scene following the death of his victim, has been arrested. The victim’s body, which is at Mpilo Central Hospital mortuary, is yet to be identified. Tapera Matizanadzo (19) from Kelvin North allegedly hit the pedestrian who was walking along Intemba road on June 25 at around 8AM. He allegedly dragged the pedestrian with his car for 16 metres and sped off from the scene. A witness allegedly gave chase and apprehended Matizanadzo who had abandoned his car and was fleeing on foot. Matizanadzo was not asked to plead to culpable homicide and negligent driving charges when he appeared before Western Commonage magistrate, Mr Lungile Ncube. The State represented by Mr Nathan Marime opposed bail saying Matizanadzo had been arrested while trying to escape. “Also the investigations are still on-going and the accused person might interfere with State witnesses,” said Mr Marime. Mr Ncube remanded him in custody to July 10 for plea recording. Mr Marime said Matizanadzo was driving along Intemba road when his vehicle hit a pedestrian. “Upon impact Matizanadzo dragged the pedestrian for 16 metres while underneath the car,” said Mr Marime. “He drove off at high speed and a witness who was following behind him gave chase. Later Matizanadzo dumped his car and was apprehended while fleeing on foot.” The court heard that the deceased is yet to be identified. @SlyCee10
