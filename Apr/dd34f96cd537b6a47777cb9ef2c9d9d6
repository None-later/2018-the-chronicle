 Thandeka Moyo, Health Reporter A BULAWAYO family is appealing to members of the public to help raise $770 for medical bills for a family member who was recently diagnosed with lung cancer. Mr Rhinos Njodzi said he was diagnosed with cancer early this month and needs to do further tests to ascertain the stage before he can access any medication. “I used to work at Kelvin where I was transporting and off-loading logs and then get commission. One day in April 2015, a log fell on my chest and on seeking medical attention I was told that one of my lungs had been badly affected,” said Mr Njodzi. He said his situation normalised for a while until early this month when he collapsed. “After a series of tests, doctors confirmed that I had a cancerous tumour beneath the dysfunctional lung. They also said I need to do a CT scan and an X-Ray and all these cost a total of $770,” said Mr Njodzi. “Since the incident I have not been able to do any hard work. My wife is a hair dresser and we survive on what she makes. I am even willing to take up any menial jobs to secure my health.” He said doctors cannot prescribe any medication as they need to know the stage of the cancer. “We can be reached on +263772748353 or +263772703043 and we stay at 4605 Nketa 7 in Bulawayo,” Mr Njodzi said.—@thamamoe
