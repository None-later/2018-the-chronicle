Hardlife Zvirekwi Tadious Manyepo, Harare Bureau CAPS United captain Hardlife Zvirekwi is finally back into the Green Machine mix after coach Lloyd Chitembwe included the right-back in his 18-man squad for the battle against Harare City at Rufaro this afternoon. The 31-year-old has not seen action since the start of the season after he had his right wrist amputated following a car crash in the off-season. While Zvirekwi is back in the team, Method Mwanjali, who is yet to be registered with the PSL, will have to wait a little bit longer to start playing a part for the Green Machine. Vice-captain Stephen Makatuka, who missed the last four games for Makepekepe, due to an injury is also back in the team. And so is Dennis Dauda and Praise Tonha who have of late been linked with moves away from Makepekepe. First-choice goalkeeper Prosper Chigumba, who has been sent off twice this season, is also back from suspension. Harare City captain Tendai Samanja says they were not ntimidated and will approach today’s match with a winning mentality. “Caps United are a big team and they should be treated as such, but we should not be intimidated by their stature,” said Samanja. ‘’This is Premiership football in which a team should reserve a certain level of respect but should be confident enough to play whoever they meet. “Odds are obviously against us, but in the first leg which ended in a goalless draw, it was the same thing. ‘’We were supposed to win that match given the chances we created but before the match Caps United were the favourites. “This time around, Caps are also the favourites to win the game but, we are also a team good enough to stop any team in the league.’’
