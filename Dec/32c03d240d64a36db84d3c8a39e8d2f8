The Walking Dead actress took to Twitter to share the news. “I’m excited to announce today that I’m joining forces with UN Women as Goodwill Ambassador to help continue in the fight for gender equality and women’s rights,” tweeted Gurira. Goodwill Ambassadors are prominent individuals who volunteer to highlight important areas of the UN’s work.

UN Women, a United Nations entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women said they would be closely working with Gurira in empowering women and raising awareness.

Famed for her role on Black Panther, Gurira has been involved in several campaigns like the #LoveOurGirls campaign which advocates for immigrant women and girls trying to escape violence as well as the #WildlifeTrafficking, an anti-wildlife trafficking campaign. This latest appointment comes at a time when the actress’ career has been flourishing as she featured in two successful films of 2018, Black Panther and The Avengers: Infinity War. She also won the People’s Choice Award for “Action Star of 2018” and clinched a deal with Reebok as the face of their campaign #BeMoreHuman.
