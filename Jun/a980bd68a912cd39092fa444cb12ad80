Business Reporter IN an attempt to strengthen the continent’s trading ability, the United States Agency for International Development (USAid) in collaboration with INTL FCStone, a NASDAQ listed US-based company, will be hosting a landmark conference that will strategically tackle commodity challenges, highlight tax harmonisations, and outline a viable roadmap for inter-regional and cross-border trade in Africa. The “Southern Africa Structured Trade Seminar” will take place at the Avani Victoria Falls Resort in Livingstone, Zambia, from June 26-29, 2018. “It is envisaged the conference will boost trade and investment in Southern Africa, drive commercial expansion, and address gaps in trade finance. It is hoped through this constructive engagement, Africa’s ability to trade and drive economic growth will be profoundly strengthened,” organisers said in statement. “The seminar will also provide participants the opportunity to experience structured trade platforms on a simulated transactional basis, and numerous opportunities for investment matchmaking and business-to-business trade facilitation.” The three-day event will provide a platform where experts from private equity firms, financial institutions, commodity exchanges, mineral and agribusiness will discuss investment match-making and business-to-business facilitation. The conference is also set to assist delegates to gain economic advantage, mitigate trade risks, develop commodity marketing while structuring and packaging commercially viable finance. Regulators will be able to develop and implement regulatory frameworks that enhance market efficiency and stability, while policymakers will look at national best practices. Trade and investment in Africa is fast changing in the digital age, and so are regional policies hence Southern Africa and the continent at large need to adopt proactive measures to enhance their trade gains.
