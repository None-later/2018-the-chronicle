 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter OVER 50 golfers will take to the Bulawayo Country Club greens tomorrow morning for the Mbada Golf Society (MGS) bi-annual tournament. The two-day tournament tees off at the Bulawayo Country Club before shifting to Harry Allen Golf Club the following morning. MGS tournament is played for a year with participants accumulating points at the end of each monthly game. At the end of the season, the golfer with the most points is crowned champion and wins the green jacket. MGS captain Tonderayi Gavu said: “We will use the medal play format and we expect competition to be tough. Mbada will be supported by Huni Golf Society from Mashonaland, whose captain is Edmore Chagaresango. Over 20 golfers are expected to arrive today with others coming in the morning.” The medal play format is another term for stroke play. That is, a round of golf in which the score is kept by counting strokes and totalling them. The player with the lowest total is the winner. Gavu said the major aim of the bi-annual golf tournament was to support junior golf in the region and to support less privileged members of the community through golf. Defending champion Chris Magosvongwe, Brain Sanangurai, Margret Vera and Magura Mhaka are in contention for the green jacket.
