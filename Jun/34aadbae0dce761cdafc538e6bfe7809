 Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter MATABELELAND South province have set a budget of $76 000 to take 507 athletes and officials to this year’s rebranded Zimbabwe National Youth Games in August. Midlands will play host to this year’s edition that will be played over two weeks. The rebranded games will have primary school participants for the first time, with Under-13s competing in the opening week alongside Under-18s. The Under-23s will battle it out in the second week of the games. Lifa Mpofu, the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) Matabeleland South coordinator, said they had started looking for funds. “As the sports body, we’re mobilising resources to take the team to the Midlands. We’ve put in place some activities to fundraise for the team’s affiliation fees. Our budget for the rebranded games is $76 000 and we intend to take along 507 athletes and officials,” Mpofu said. He said they will not field athletes in canoeing, shooting and seniors’ rugby. “Some of the challenges we’re facing include getting players into camp because the province is very broad in terms of distance. Some athletes come from as far as Dombodema in Plumtree and others from Beitbridge,” said Mpofu.
