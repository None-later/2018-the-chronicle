President ED Mnangagwa Norman Muchemwa, Harare Bureau GOVERNMENT has started distributing inputs under the Presidential Input Scheme, about four months before the start of the summer farming season to ensure they reach beneficiaries on time. Farmers have over the years been complaining about late distribution of the inputs which at times started after the onset of the rains. Addressing thousands of Zanu-PF supporters at a rally at Chipadze Stadium on Saturday, President Emmerson Mnangagwa attributed the early distribution of inputs to hard work by Government. “We have already started distributing inputs under the Presidential input scheme. What kind of Government can you yearn for? “We are in July and you usually received inputs between October and November. “Early distribution of Presidential input scheme. This is due to hard work from my team. If you do not perform then we can never work together,” said President Mnangagwa. He said inputs under the Command Agriculture scheme will also be released soon. “There is also Command Agriculture, the inputs will also be coming soon. There are those who supervise that area.” President Mnangagwa said because of Command Agriculture Zimbabwe will never suffer from hunger again.
