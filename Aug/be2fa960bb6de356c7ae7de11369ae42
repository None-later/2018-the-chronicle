 Sports Reporter BULAWAYO rugby enthusiasts are in for a treat when Matabeleland Warriors and Old Miltonians clash in the final of the Shingirai Brian Nyabunze Foundation rugby tournament at Hartsfield Ground this afternoon. The tournament, sponsored by CONSHA Enterprises director Shasha Gomez, is meant to celebrate the life of Nyabunze, a former Christian Brothers College (CBC) first team rugby player who died in a car accident in 2012. Bulawayo’s four teams, Matabeleland Warriors, Old Miltonians, Highlanders and Bulldogs took part in the tournament which ran over four weekends and played in a round robin format. A mouth-watering final between Old Miltonians and Matabeleland Warriors is on the cards, with the former out for revenge having lost 14-19 during the group stages. Besides the trophy and the $500 prize money for winners, bragging rights are at stake for the finalists. Matabeleland Warriors’ women’s team will square off against a Bulawayo Ladies Select at 1:15PM with the main curtain raiser being the Milton High School and Western Suburbs boys’ clash an hour later. Highlanders will be presented with their bronze medals, after beating Bulldogs 34-12.
