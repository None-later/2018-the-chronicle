Descent Dube, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Teachers Association (Zimta) netball team booked a semi-finals slot at the Southern African Teachers’ Association (Sato) Annual Games, recording two successive wins against Tanzania and Lesotho at United College of Education in Bulawayo yesterday. The Zimta netball team clobbered Tanzania 29-1 and beat Lesotho 13-9. Zimbabwe, drawn in Pool A with Malawi, Lesotho and Tanzania, will know their opponents from Pool B that is made up of Botswana, South Africa and Swaziland after group games this morning. The games, which have attracted about 1 000 teachers from seven Southern African countries – South Africa, Botswana, Malawi, Swaziland, Lesotho, Tanzania and hosts Zimbabwe — kicked off late due to the late arrival of South Africa. The participants will compete in nine disciplines namely football, netball, basketball, volleyball, athletics, darts, tennis, table tennis and chess.  They will also have a symposium where they will discuss issues affecting their profession. @DecoDecent2
