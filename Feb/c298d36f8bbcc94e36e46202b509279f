Lovemore Zigara, Midlands Correspondent REDCLIFF has set a target of developing 30 000 housing units by 2023 as it seeks to upgrade to city status. The satellite town has about 5 000 housing units, which council feels has resulted in poor revenue inflows. Redcliff Mayor Councillor Freddy Kapuya said council has entered into public private partnership (PPPs) with private land developers, to service land so as to increase the number of housing units in the town. “We have entered into private public partnerships with local private developers who have the equipment to service the land. Under the arrangement we are saying council will have 40 percent of all the serviced stands while the huge chunk is given to the developer to sell,” he said. “We want to increase the number of housing units in the town to 30 000 because we have also realised that the few housing units in the city has also impacted us negatively in as far as revenue collection is concerned. Therefore, more housing units will mean that there is also significant revenue inflows.” Cllr Kapuya said the town council is currently developing about 5 000 stands for residents to get accommodation. “There is a bit of revenue, which is coming from the sale of stands and as we speak we have run out of serviced stands in Redcliff but the good thing is that we are the only local authority with vast tracts of land of our own. “As we speak we are developing about 5 000 stands an exercise, which is currently underway,” added the mayor. He said council wants to ensure the stands were well serviced and have proper water and sewer systems, as well as roads. @lavuzigara1
