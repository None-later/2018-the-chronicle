 Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Premier Soccer League media audio-visual media rights tender officially closes today amid fears that the local game might not be broadcast anytime soon if the bidders fail to meet expected standards. This is the second time that the league has sent out bids for potential broadcasting rights following the pulling away of Supersport who got into a rather controversial marriage with the league in 2012. The coming of SuperSport was greeted with joy after the league had found no joy with national broadcaster, Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, who insisted on being paid to screen matches. SuperSport, however, brought a different dispensation although the total value of the deal was not clear with sources saying clubs were getting a share of approximately $23 400 which came in two batches every season. But fans were not happy with the infrequency of the broadcast as the league matches would sometimes be frozen from the screen without explanation. Some clubs also complained that they did not get fair coverage compared to the bigger teams who always draw the limelight. And, amid the discrepancies, the big teams also complained that they deserved a bigger chunk of the financial allocation from the disbursements by SuperSport. The new official partners will have to at least better the package previously offered by SuperSport and are also expected to prove that they have the capacity to broadcast and fulfill contractual obligations like paying the clubs their share. Dr Dish, whose marriage with Econet Media and Kwese TV collapsed in spectacular fashion, last week told this publication that they had not submitted their bid for the broadcasting rights but it was not clear last night whether they have had a change of heart ahead of todayâ€™s deadline. A total of 72 matches with a total of 6 480 minutes have since taken place this season.
