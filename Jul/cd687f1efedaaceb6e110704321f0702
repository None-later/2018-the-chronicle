Cheetahs THE 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens kicked off last night at AT&T Park in San Francisco and Zimbabwe is geared up to turn the tables. The Cheetahs are the continent’s fourth representative at the competition along with Kenya, South Africa and Uganda. Undaunted by their first fixture against Wales, the Cheetahs will be fielding two captains, Stephan Hunduza and Boyd Rouse. “We’re not worried about Wales,” said Hunduza. “As Zimbabweans, we have speed. Our pressure has been on perfecting the skills we’ve been working on whilst utilising our speed,” he said. Rouse added: “Going into this World Cup, we’ve got a good combination of speed, skill and physicality when needed against certain opposition.” Zimbabwe will be fielding a younger team, which will be looking to make early scores in the first two to three minutes of each fixture. The selection of younger players is borne out of a need to establish continuity by developing younger players able to commit more time thereby contributing to the team’s competitive advantage. “We attended the Rome Sevens three weeks ago which helped our young players prepare for what’s coming ahead,” said Zimbabwe sevens head coach Gilbert Nyamutsamba. “They managed to play at an international tournament, rubbing shoulders with great players and I’m happy that most of our players stood out.” Indeed Zimbabwe’s Shayne Makombe was crowned Player of The Tournament, as the team finished second. “My work now is to keep the players grounded,” continued Nyamutsamba. “Yes, it’s a World Cup where you’re representing your country; a dream come true for most of these young men, but at the same time, it’s still a rugby game and we need to approach it as such.” Cheetahs squad for 2018 RWC 7s Boyd Rouse, Connor Pritchard, Nelson Madida, Kudakwashe Chiwanza, Ngoni Chibuwe, Shayne Makombe, Tafadzwa Chitokwindo, Biselele Tshamala, Shingirai Hlanguyo, Tarisai Mugariri, Stephan Hunduza and Riaan O’Niell. — Sport360.com
