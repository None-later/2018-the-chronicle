 Argentina v Croatia (20.00) After making their best start to a World Cup in 20 years thanks to their 2-0 defeat of Nigeria, Croatia are in relaxed mood ahead of their meeting with the Group D favourites. Any kind of result against Argentina will allow the Vatreni to take a big step towards the Round of 16. La Albiceleste are in an entirely different situation. The unexpected draw with tournament debutants Iceland has left Jorge Sampaoli’s side with much to do ahead of what looks to be their toughest assignment in the section. A win is vital if they are to avoid a nerve-wracking final match. Yet if there is one thing that Argentina proved on their tortuous journey to Russia it is that they can respond when under pressure. Speaking after the Nigeria game, Mario Mandzukic said Croatia’s objective was to perform well and, if they could, emulate the nation’s run at France 1998, the only occasion on which they advanced beyond the group phase in their previous four world finals appearances. — Fifa.com
