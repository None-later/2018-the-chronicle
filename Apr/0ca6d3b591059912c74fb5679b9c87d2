Jairos Tapera Lovemore Zigara in Gweru ZIMBABWE General Medical Aid Central Soccer League side Sheasham have made changes to their technical department by roping in former Yadah FC coach Jairos Tapera as technical manager just two games into the season. Sheasham were the busiest club in the transfer market during the off-season and the most expensively assembled side in the second tier league. They swooped on former Caps United goalkeeper Victor Twaliki, ex-Dynamos anchorman Stephen Alimenda and Michael Mageja, among other players with Premiership experience, as they seek to lift the title in their debut season. However, the newcomers are yet to record a win after falling 0 -1 to Chrome Stars on the opening day of the season followed by a goalless draw army side Tongogara. Sheasham chairman Malvern Paradza confirmed the appointment of Tapera as technical manager and said head coach Jeremiah Neganda retains his post. “I can confirm that we have appointed Jairos Tapera as the technical manager with immediate effect and he will now be in charge of the technical team. Jeremiah Neganda has retained his position as head coach. We have confidence that the technical department will deliver on the team’s objectives and aspirations,” said Paradza. Tapera, who watched the Tongogara game on Sunday from the terraces, will oversee his first game when Sheasham travel to Gwanda for a date against struggling Blanket Mine, who have lost their opening two games. Tapera is not new to the CSL, having guided FC Platinum, which was then known as Mimosa, into the Premier Soccer League in 2010. @lavuzigara1
