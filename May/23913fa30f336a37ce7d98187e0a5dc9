Lovemore Zigara in Gweru POLICE outfit Black Eagles became the first team in the Zimbabwe General Medical Aid Fund Central Soccer League to breach Sheasham’s defence in a 1–1 stalemate at Simbi Grounds in Buchwa at the weekend. Sheasham, who remain unbeaten, went into the match boasting of an impeccable defence that had shut out all teams they had played against. However, Isaac Chimani gave the police outfit the lead before Sheasham equalised through a second half penalty converted by Tinei Chitora. Sheasham coach Jeremiah Neganda was a livid man and accused Eagles of employing delaying tactics, saying his charges never got into their rhythm due to time wasting by Eagles. “We are on the right track and the good thing is that we managed to avoid defeat. It is always difficult to play when your opponents are engaging in time wasting tactics which affected our play. “We look forward to the next game and hope we return to winning ways,” Neganda said. His counterpart Oscar Muvhimi shot back and accused match officials of biased officiating against his team, but expressed satisfaction with the performance of his team. “We could have beaten them had it not been for some decisions which went against my team. I must admit though that Sheasham is a good team with a lot of experience. We look forward to better performances as we have finished our rebuilding exercise,” said Muvhimi. In the other fixture, played at the weekend, Tongogara were held to a 1–1 draw by FC Platinum Under-19 to remain in eighth position on the log table. Calvin Maphosa, the Tongogara gaffer, said his side needs to remain positive and focus on the next game, while FC Platinum Under-19 coach Jacob Chavugama believes his side can compete for a top eight finish. Results Tongogara 1–1 FC Platinum U19, Black Eagles 1–1 Sheasham. @lavuzigara1
