 Yemurai Ushamba, Chronicle Reporter A TAXI driver from Cowdray Park suburb in Bulawayo, who impregnated a minor, has been dragged to court by his ex-mother-in-law for the upkeep of his minor child. Mrs Sithandazile Tshuma approached the court demanding $160 from Ephraim Mpofu for the upkeep of a five-month-old son he had with her daughter. Mrs Tshuma said she was applying for maintenance on behalf of her daughter who is 16-years-old. She also said she only knows that her son-in-law is a taxi driver but does not know much about him. “I am requesting for $160 for the upkeep of my grandson. I do not know much about his father but if the court wishes to ask any questions my daughter is waiting outside. I am applying for maintenance on her behalf because she is only 16-years-old,” she said. Mpofu offered $20 for the upkeep of his son. He said $160 was too much for him considering he has other expenses and responsibilities. “Your Worship, I cannot afford $160. I am employed as a taxi driver and I earn $100 a month. My parents who stay in the rural areas depend on me and I also pay rent where I stay. I can only afford $20 a month,” Mpofu said. Bulawayo magistrate, Ms Adelaide Mbeure, requested to speak to the minor and ordered all third parties to vacate the court room. Ms Mbeure later ordered Mpofu to pay $45 for the upkeep of his son.—@YUshamba
