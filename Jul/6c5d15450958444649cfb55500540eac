 Lisa Mangena, Court Reporter A BULAWAYO police officer was allegedly rushed to hospital clutching his manhood after his wife assaulted him for “stealing her clothes.” Melody Mpofu (38) of Mpopoma suburb allegedly hit Mr Canaan Phiri (45) once on the testicles. The couple fought after Mpofu allegedly took $480 from Mr Phiri’s wallet, which she said she would use to replace the stolen clothes. Mpofu pleaded guilty to theft and assault before Western Commonage Magistrate Mrs Tancy Dube. She was remanded out of custody to August 26 on free bail. Mr Phiri told the court that on May 3, he went to bed and Mpofu followed, accusing him of stealing her clothes. “I went to bed and Mpofu followed me asking where her clothes were. I told her I did not know and she started shouting at me,” Mr Phiri said. “After a short argument, Mpofu took $480 from my wallet, put it in her handbag and we started fighting for the bag,” he added. Mr Phiri wanted to use the money for starting his own business, the court heard. As the two were fighting, the court heard, Mpofu hit her husband with her knee on his private parts and also bit him on the left arm. Mr Phiri fell down and while he was on the floor, Mpofu proceeded to the kitchen and brought a knife intending to stab him. “She tried to stab me in the chest with a kitchen knife. I shoved her aside,” he said. Mr Phiri later reported the matter at Western Commonage Police Station. A medical report can be produced in court. Mr Brian Nkala prosecuted. @LissahMangena
