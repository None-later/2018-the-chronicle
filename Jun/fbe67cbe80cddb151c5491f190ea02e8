Mr Nelson Chamisa Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent FOLLOWING MDC-T Alliance presidential candidate Nelson Chamisa’s documented utterances where he stretches the truth in public, social media has gone into overdrive with a #ChamisaChallenge emerging. Chamisa seems to have developed a penchant for lying whenever he addresses his party supporters at rallies. His most recent gaffe is when he was exposed for lying and was called out by Rwanda President Paul Kagame who disputed his claims that he assisted the country in crafting its ICT policy. While addressing a rally in Beitbridge last Saturday, Chamisa claimed that he assisted President Kagame to craft his nation’s ICT policy when they met in Geneva, Switzerland. Chamisa also claimed that the Rwanda President was impressed by his ideas when he was then Minister of Information and Communication Technology during the inclusive Government era. President Kagame however, disputed Chamisa’s claims on his Twitter handle. After that, a #ChamisaChallenge to imitate the way the politician lies ensued on Twitter and below are some of the posts. Musician Vusa Mkhaya weighed in and posted: “One day Chamisa arrived late at school. The other students were punished because they arrived too early. Chamisa went to school so that he could be studied. #ChamisaChallenge #FuthiNikisi.” Umahlekisa Comedy Club founder Ntando Van Moyo claimed Chamisa was instrumental in capturing the Cowdray Park goblin. #ChamisaChallenge, Chamisa provided the potions that defeated the Cowdray Park Tikoloshi.” One Leslee Chibweþ wrote: “Chamisa is Meghan Markle’s friend who set her up with Prince Harry #NelsonChamisaChallenge.” #Buheþ @IamBuhe: “Chamisa helped negotiate for the release of Nelson Mandela from prison #NelsonChamisaChallenge.” senecaþ @murembi9XL: “Chamisa was instrumental in bringing North Korea and South Korea leaders to the negotiating table #ChamisaChallenge.” Vasheþ @PTChimusoro: “Nelson Chamisa helped Moses to write the 10 commandments on the stone tablets.
