 Lovemore Zigara, Midlands Correspondent THE Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) has partnered the Midlands State University in setting up entrepreneurship incubation hubs to help nurture upcoming businesses. Business incubators in some countries have been a catalyst for either regional or national economic development. CZI Midlands chamber president Mr Mike Dzinoreva said the incubation hubs will offer technical support and other services to new businesses. “The Midlands Chamber is working with the Midlands State University (MSU) in setting up an entrepreneurship incubation hub. The hub will assist new and upcoming businesses,” he said. “As you may be aware, a number of companies fail during the first three years of inception and this will try and support those upcoming businesses to survive through technical support and a think tank that is going to support this hub,” added Mr Dzinoreva. He said they have also partnered local polytechnics “to promote competitiveness through innovation.” “The Midlands Chamber has partnered local tertiary institutions on research and development programmes to promote competitiveness through innovation. Kwekwe and Gweru Polytechnics are currently undertaking a survey on the list of companies in the Midlands chamber,” said Mr Dzinoreva. “The objective is to find out the challenges being encountered by companies in terms of retooling requirements and possible turnaround strategies.” In 2016, CZI partnered local academic institutions to do a research on the state of the Midlands industries. The findings of the research and the recommendations, which are being done by Gweru and Kwekwe Polytechnic colleges will be presented to the Office of the President. Figures by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Enterprise Development show the province experienced 13 major company closures since 2009, which saw over 4 185 workers losing jobs. Some of the companies include Ziscosteel, Zimglass, Mike Appel and Lancashire Steel. @lavuzigara1
