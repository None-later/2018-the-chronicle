Patrice Motsepe MAMELODI Sundowns president Patrice Motsepe has given his blessing to coach Pitso Mosimane should he wish to take a break from coaching. Mosimane has declared his consideration of a break from coaching after five-and-a-half gruelling years, maintaining The Brazilians’ status as one of the top clubs in the country. The former Bafana Bafana mentor has led the Tshwane side to three league titles, a Caf Champions League, a Caf Super Cup, a Nedbank Cup and Telkom Knockout triumphs during his time at the helm, and last enjoyed an off-season break in 2013, when Downs finished in 10th position after escaping the relegation zone within five months of his arrival. This has prompted ‘Jingles’ to consider some time away from the game to catch-up with his family. “I want to take a break. This has not stopped for five years,” he bemoaned. “You lose your family and other things from outside football also affect your family, so you start to say things like, ‘This happens because I’m never home.’ “We are not machines, we are human beings. Your mind is going all the time, sometimes it’s not your body, but your mind. “I can’t complain, it’s part of the job. I’m blessed in football, so I’m not complaining about football, but this is the way I feel.” Motsepe has since expressed his backing for Mosimane, comparing his situation to that of Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, who took a sabbatical after four illustrious years with Barcelona between 2008 and 2012. “I’ve said, if Bafana wants Pitso then we have to let him go because South Africa is much more important than my personal plans and ambitions,” conceded Motsepe. “But Guardiola had a rest, and I will support that; it’s very, very important. But, even if he goes and rests, he can still come back. I’m very, very proud of Pitso.” — KickOff
