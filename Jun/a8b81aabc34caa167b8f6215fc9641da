 Grace Nyoni, Midlands Reporter POLICE in the Midlands Province have banned the carrying of dangerous weapons to maintain peace ahead of the harmonised elections scheduled for July 30. In a statement yesterday, acting Midlands provincial police Spokesperson Assistant Inspector Ethel Mukwende said the ban was effective from July 1 and will lapse on August 31. She said the ban was being made in terms of the Public Order and Security Act (POSA). Asst Insp Mukwende said the ban was coming at a time when there is an increase in violence cases, with weapons such as machetes being used across the province. She said anyone who violates the ban is liable to a fine or imprisonment of six months or both. “Anyone who is found with the prohibited weapons shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding six months imprisonment or both. “The ban is with immediate effect since cases of people being attacked and murdered are victims of such weapons being used on them,” said Asst Insp Mukwende. She said the banned weapons include axes, catapults, machetes, knobkerries, swords, knives, daggers and all traditional weapons that are likely to breach peace. Asst Insp Mukwende said police in Shurugwi, Gweru, Kwekwe and Redcliff have already started effecting dangerous weapons bans in their respective areas. Police in Gwanda and Beitbridge among other areas have also effected a ban on dangerous weapons. “District Regulatory Officers have already started implementing the ban in areas like Shurugwi, Gweru, Kwekwe and Redcliff. “In terms of Section 14 of Public Order and Security Act chapter 11, we announce the ban on carrying and use of objects that can be used as weapons in public so as to restore order in the Midlands,” Asst Insp Mukwende said.
