Samson Muripo Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE 2017 Sportsperson of the Year Samson Muripo is leading a five-member Zimbabwe team at the 2018 edition of the World So-kyokushin All-Japan Karate tournament that gets underway this weekend. The team also includes Naison Chituwa, Likhwa Khumalo, Admire Chingozhoro and Tangayi Mhlanga, who left early this week for the martial arts event that will bring together fighters from over 20 countries. “We are expecting at least three medals from the competition. Shihan Muripo has vast experience of fighting at such a high profile tournament. Sensei Admire has won international tournaments before and the return of our legend Sensei Khumalo on the tatami is very special for us. Chituwa and Mhlanga have had a taste of international exposure before and we are excited to see how they will use the lessons they learnt in previous tournaments. These are exciting times for Zimbabwe Karate Union (ZKU). We are happy with the number and quality of fighters we managed to send, thanks to Nyaradzo (Funeral Parlour) who partnered us for the trip,” said ZKU marketing and media executive Grace Chirumanzu. The Japan tournament comes after Chirumanzu herself shone like a beacon to bag a bronze medal at the 5th UK International Kyokushin Cup last week. After the Japan tournament, the Karatekas are also expected to take part in the AFCKO annual full contact competition in South Africa on May 26 before exhibiting their fighting skills on home soil in the national open tournament at the Chitungwiza Aquatic Complex on July 28.
