TWENTY-THREE coaches took part in an International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) Coaches Education and Certification Systems (CECS) Level 1 course that ended at White City Stadium yesterday. The course, which was organised by the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (NAAZ), saw aspiring coaches from the country’s 10 provinces and two from Botswana graduating after the 12-day training. Certified IAAF lecturers Tendai Tagara and Lisimati Phakamile conducted the clinic. Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) chairman Manuel Mpofu said the participants underwent some practical assessment on Tuesday followed by yesterday’s theory assessment. “We are happy the course was a success with 23 coaches graduating at the end. We are looking forward to seeing some improvement in the way athletics is done in the country having conducted two coaching courses this month. With the season starting next year, I encourage coaches to implement the knowledge they got in these two courses,” said Mpofu. The CECS Level 1 course aims to develop skills to organise and prepare children between the ages of 13 and 15 years for athletics. It came following a Technical Officials Education and Certification System (TOECS) Level 1 coaching course which ended in Bulawayo last week in which 22 coaches graduated.
