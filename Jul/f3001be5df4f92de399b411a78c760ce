 Yemurai Ushamba, Court Reporter A BULAWAYO woman who stole a cellphone from a 13-year-old pupil when she was pregnant to raise money for her unborn baby’s preparation has been fined $100. Thandekile Ndlovu (20), a mother of two, appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Lungile Ncube, holding her six-weeks-old baby in her hands. Ndlovu pleaded guilty to theft and Mr Ncube fined her $100. “I admit I stole the phone but I only wanted to raise money for my unborn baby’s preparation. Since I was two months pregnant, my husband was in the habit of drinking too much. He spent all his earnings on beer. Since I did not work I had to act because the baby needed clothes,” said a teary Ndlovu. In sentencing her, Mr Ncube said he considered that she was a first time offender and female. “I take in consideration you are a first and female offender but that does not mean you will not go unpunished,” said Mr Ncube. The court heard that Ndlovu stole the phone from Tiyamike Ziba (13). Prosecuting, Mr Nathan Marime said on March 14 this year, Ndlovu proceeded to the Ziba’s place of residence to buy chicken. “While inside the house, Ndlovu asked Ziba to fetch her some water to drink. Ndlovu took advantage of the minor’s absence and took a ZTE cellphone. She went away unnoticed,” he said. The court heard that the matter was reported to the police and investigations were launched leading to Ndlovu’s arrest. In her affidavit, Ziba stated that Ndlovu said she was feeling dizzy and asked for some water to drink. She said after she went inside, Ndlovu vanished without buying the chicken or drinking the water. Total value of stolen property was $73 and it was recovered. — @YUshamba
