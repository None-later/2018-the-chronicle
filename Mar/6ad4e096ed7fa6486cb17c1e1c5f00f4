 Lovemore Zigara in Gweru STONARD Mapfumo was re-elected the Zimbabwe Softball Association (ZSA) president for another four years during an elective annual general meeting held in Harare over the weekend. Other members of the executive include Elizabeth Mabhugu who will deputise Mapfumo while Witness Nkomo is the secretary general and Leah Mashambanaka will keep the association’s purse. The five members elected form the management committee of softball that when joined by provincial associations and affiliates chairs make the executive committee. Nominations of candidates and voting were made by official representatives  of provincial softball associations and represented were Bulawayo, Matabeleland South, Masvingo, Harare, Mashonaland West and  Mashonaland Central. The meeting was initially pencilled for 10 March at the Sports and Recreation Commission offices in Harare but had to be adjourned to this past weekend after the congregation failed to constitute a quorum of 75 percent by two provinces. “Our plan for now is to ensure the sustainability of the sport administrative wise.  We also want to pursue the collection of sport levies and affiliations from members that have not yet paid membership fees,” said Mapfumo. “We will also be engaging Botswana Softball on upgrading of officials by WBSC certified instructors so that we can become a force to reckon with in Africa,” added Mapfumo. The ZSA president said his immediate task is to ensure that a rolling of a cumulative points club championships are held to come up with teams to represent Zimbabwe at the Region 5 Softball Senior Men and Ladies Clubs Championships in Botswana in October. He said the association will also select and send an Under-19 girls softball team to World Championship qualifiers in Lesotho in September as well as participating in the Africa/Europe Softball Tokyo2020 Olympic Games qualifiers in 2019. @lavuzigara1
