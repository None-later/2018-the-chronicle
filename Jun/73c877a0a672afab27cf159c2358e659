 KAIZER Chiefs legend, Mark Williams, believes Khama Billiat would be an ideal acquisition for his former club. The Zimbabwe international is set to leave Mamelodi Sundowns at the end of the month after opting against renewing his contract with the Tshwane giants. This has led to much speculation surrounding his future with some of the biggest Absa Premier Soccer League (PSL) clubs, including Amakhosi, having been linked with the 27-year-old’s services. Meanwhile, the Soweto giants have already made their intentions known that they intend on bolstering their squad in order to avoid going a fourth consecutive season without silverware, and Williams is adamant that Chiefs should look to Billiat in order to turn their fortunes around. The former Ajax Cape Town star has also been linked with moves to Europe, with Azerbaijan side Qarabag having previously tabled an offer. “It is very interesting, I would like to see where he is going to go because I mean Chiefs need to get some silverware and a player like Khama can add value to their team,” Williams told Vodacom Soccer. Williams though believes that if Chiefs do sign Billiat, he should be utilised behind the striker as a playmaker. “Maybe if he goes to Chiefs they will put him behind the strikers and not as a striker like at Sundowns, where they play with a lot of pace,” he added. “There is a need for Chiefs to buy quality players going into the new season and Khama has that experience having played a big part in the success of Sundowns in recent years,” he continued. “He has been one of the great players in our league and for me it would be nice because what Chiefs needs is youth and top quality players,” he concluded. Nonetheless, with Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane still eager to keep hold of his talisman it remains to be seen just where Billiat will end up. — Goal.com
