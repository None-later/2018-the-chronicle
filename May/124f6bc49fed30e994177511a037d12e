 Sukoluhle Ndlovu, Midlands Correspondent THE Zimbabwe National Road Administration (Zinara) has allocated over $500 000 to Chirumanzu Rural District Council for road rehabilitation programmes. Chirumanzu RDC Engineer Cuthbert Kwera said the council has already finished rehabilitating tarred roads in Mvuma CBD and would soon work on roads within residential areas. “We recently finished putting tarred roads in the CBD and our focus now is to do the same in residential areas. The aim is to improve the road network in the district. “We were given an allocation of $526 791 by Zinara and that will go a long way,” he said. “For now we are finalising the procurement process and once that is done we will also look at the contractors that are bidding following the tendering process. Work is expected to commence in two weeks.” Eng Kwera said council was set to receive another allocation for emergency road funds to rehabilitate damaged roads in other areas outside Mvuma. Chirumanzu RDC chairperson Councillor Tapera Dzitirai said they have also engaged local communities in building new roads especially in resettlement areas. He said the project was empowering youths as they get paid for the work they are doing in opening new roads. @sukusinini
