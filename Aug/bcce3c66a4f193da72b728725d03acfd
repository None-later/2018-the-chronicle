 Descent Dube, Sports Reporter THE Spar Bonsa T20 cricket League enters the play-off stages on Sunday which will feature a repeat of last week’s fixtures. The play-offs will be played at Old Mutual Heath Streak Cricket Academy over two rounds in a top versus bottom format. All teams still have a chance to make it to the final despite their current position on the table. Log leaders Badgers will play against bottom side Sabres, who have only won one match. Raptors entertain the Hawks, while Blazers take on Tigers. Blazers’ skipper Njabulo Ncube said his team wants to go all the way to the final. “We started decently and in the third game we managed to find good balance within the squad. For us it’s just a matter of improving in everything and having everyone in the team to contribute. The first stage of the tournament has been good, but we will stay humble and positive in order to end in the best possible position,” said Ncube. He said Blazers are not under any pressure despite the fact that they will be playing the same opponent for the second time in six days adding that his team is spoiled for choices since everyone in the team can win a game. “We don’t really worry much who we are playing because our type of play is simple as we look to bat 20 overs and look to bowl teams out. We actually don’t play names; our contest is bat and ball,” Ncube said. The league will take a break for the Heroes weekend holiday and it will resume with a double header on August 18 and 19 as a build up to the final which will be held on August 29. Fixtures Sunday: Badgers v Sabres, Raptors v Hawks, Blazers v Tigers
