John Nyikadzino Lovemore Zigara in Gweru PREMIERSHIP newboys Nichrut return to Ascot Stadium tomorrow, looking for a win against army side Black Rhinos in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match. Nichrut, who have collected four points in their last five matches, will be out for a victory as they seek to move away from the relegation zone. The Shurugwi-based side is on position 11 with 13 points from 13 games, just a point above relegation. Nichrut gaffer John Nyikadzino said his charges are ready for Black Rhinos adding that they are hard-pressed for maximum points in their endeavor to swim away from the murky relegation waters. “We are preparing for the game and we want a win on Sunday. It won’t be easy but we are working very hard to come out with a positive result. We have been playing well but results have been eluding us. We have to step up our game if we are to remain in the league. The boys know what is expected of them and I am happy they are responding well and come Sunday I am sure the community of Shurugwi will be happy,” said Nyikadzino. Nichrut have had decent displays of late and with their fans rallying behind them. They go into the game smarting from a 0-1 loss to FC Platinum. However, the army side are not pushovers if their recent performances are anything to go by. Chauya Chipembere would count themselves unlucky for failing to win after giving a vintage display against Harare giants Dynamos before settling for a 1-1 draw in a match which they led for the better part on Thursday. — @lavuzigara1
