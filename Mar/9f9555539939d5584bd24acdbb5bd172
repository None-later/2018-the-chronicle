 Lynee Kumirayi, Chronicle Reporter THE National Blood Service Zimbabwe (NBSZ) has enough blood stocks to cater for emergencies during the Easter holidays, an official yesterday. The Easter holiday is among the bloodiest in terms of road carnage in the country and demand for blood usually soars during the period. NBSZ spokesperson, Mr Sifundo Ngwenya, said the blood bank had reserves likely to last until May. “As the blood bank we are ready to serve the nation during the Easter holiday. Although blood stocks are high, you never know what might happen in the interim due to change in demand,” he said. “Also the nation is being urged to donate more blood. There should be something that comes in because we really need as much blood as possible”. Mr Ngwenya said there is an upcoming blood drive being put together so that more emphasis is put on blood donations. “On April 7 there will be a ladies’ gala at Eveline High School where women will be donating blood,” he said. “We are looking forward to working together with people from places like Plumtree and also to partner with PTC so that we put together programmes that will involve the community and schools early next term. Also the Seventh Day Adventist church, Universal churches and the community in general are forthcoming in the blood donation programme.” The Easter holidays begin today. At least 220 people have been killed in 1 850 road traffic accidents that occurred during Easter holidays in the past six years, while 1 447 were injured. — @Lyneesboe
