Wilson Mutekede Tadious Manyepo, Harare Bureau Zifa Technical Director Wilson Mutekede has hailed the Nash Harare Metropolitan provincial leadership for introducing a year-round Fustal Five-Aside league in schools. The league was launched in Harare yesterday with an initial injection of $10 000 from the Population Services International. And Mutekede, who was among the guests, was full of praise for the initiative. “This is the way to go. As Zifa, we have always advocated for soccer to be played all-year round, especially in schools. “Previously, soccer used to be a termly sport and that had some negative impact, especially to those who do not develop their skills fast. “We are very happy that the NASH Harare province have come up with this initiative. We are very supportive of things like these. “Five-Aside Football is very advantageous in that it helps develop players’ dribbling and ball-controlling skills. Most countries across the globe put more thrust on it as it develops physical fitness and concentration. “We would like to see the same concept being introduced to other parts of the country, including the rural areas,” he said. Ropafadzo Matemavi, the head in charge NASH Harare Province, is confident the league will run well. “We are thankful to PSI for bailing us out. We are introducing the league in all Harare secondary schools and the districts competitions will take place on March 3 with the provincial contests coming a fortnight later. “We are very excited by this and we are willing to play our role for the development of soccer,” he said.
