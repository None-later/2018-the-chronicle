 Mashudu Netsianda, Senior Court Reporter A BULAWAYO man who held a six-year-old grudge against a police officer who investigated his case in 2012 for allegedly dealing in fake money has appeared in court for assaulting the cop in an act of revenge. Elias Gumindanga (29), who lives along Lobengula Street assaulted the cop, Brighton Tsvangirai, after spotting him at a local supermarket. The unforgiving Gumindanga appeared Bulawayo magistrate Mr Tinashe Tashaya facing a charge of assaulting a police officer. He was placed off remand and the case will proceed by way of summons pending a medical report to ascertain the gravity of Tsvangirai’s injuries. Prosecuting, Mr Maclean Ndlovu said on March 30 this year at around 4.30PM, Gumindanga confronted the complainant at a supermarket situated between Lobengula Street and 3rd Avenue. “The accused person confronted the complainant and told him that he was not happy with the manner in which he handled his case in which he (Gumindanga) was accused of dealing in fake money,” said Mr Ndlovu. The court heard that Gumindanga punched Tsvangirai several times and pulled his shirt, which he tore it to pieces before he picked up a stone and struck the police officer. He hit the complainant on the mouth and he sustained a cracked tooth. The complainant screamed and he was assisted by a member of the public and one Constable Norman Komisani who escorted him to Mzilikazi Police Station where he reported the matter. Gumindanga was arrested. The complainant was taken to hospital for medical examination.—@mashnets
