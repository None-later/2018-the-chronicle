Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) will next month convene a training workshop aimed at empowering sports administrators from May 26-27 at Eveline High School in Bulawayo. SRC Bulawayo provincial coordinator Sam Dzvimbu encouraged sports administrators to register for what he called an important course. “The level of development in sport and recreation is directly linked to the skills, technical and administrative competences endowed within the system. Courses such as this one ensure that there is smooth governance in sport associations,” said Dzvimbu. “It is of great importance that we have relevant knowledge imparted to those in top positions in sporting circles. Registration for the course is open at the SRC offices at Khumalo Hockey Stadium and closes on May 25. We invite physical education teachers, sport directors, administrators, sport associations, club executives, heads in charge of various sport codes in schools and colleges, past sportspersons, legends and all those aspiring to be in sports administration to register for this important programme,” he said. He said courses of this nature actively help to promote the development of Zimbabwean sport practitioners to positions of influence in regional, continental and international federations.
