Joseph Muchechetere Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Sports and Recreation Commission will next week hold a one-day governance and compliance workshop for both non and registered National Sports Associations. The workshop will be held in Harare on February 23 and it follows the supreme sports body’s submission and subsequent approval of its 100 day Rapid Results projects by the Government. The conference has been necessitated by the need to explain to the Sport and Recreation Organisations, the new system for the registration and licensing of National Associations, clubs and other sport and recreation organisations that the SRC will be adopting during the 100-day period ending on April 10, 2018. “During this period all the National Associations are expected to have fully complied with the dictates of the SRC Act which compel the NAs to have submitted to  the Commission audited financial statements, annual report from the president/chairperson, Annual General Meeting minutes, membership of each association and the payment of the annual levy currently pegged at $4 per annum per member, estimates of income and expenditure for the ensuing year as well as calendar of activities for both national and international events. “It is within these 100 days that we aim to ensure that all associations are compliant and we will issue them with a Registration Certificate and Operator’s Licence”, said acting SRC director general Joseph Muchechetere. The new system has been necessitated by the need to ensure that there is order and efficiency in the way National Associations and other Sport and Recreation Organisations dispense with sport and recreation business. “I must overtly state that sport can only play its role in the socio economic development of this country if it is properly organised and this is one way to achieve this objective. It is also important to state that all the National Associations that do not comply with this directive will be deregistered in line with Section 30 of the SRC Act Chapter 25:15 of 1991,” warned Muchechetere.— @skhumoyo2000.
