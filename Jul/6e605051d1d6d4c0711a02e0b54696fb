 Descent Dube, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO-based Skies Las Palmas Youth Academy is embarking on a “Catch them Young programme” for children between the ages of five and 18 as it prepares for an Under-16 Harvest in Sport youth tournament to be held in Harare in December. The academy, which focuses on both girls and boys, seeks to produce a soccer loving young generation and co-director Gremah Ndebele said the tournament will be graced by high profile football personnel. “With these kinds of tournaments, we expose our kids to the huge picture of their careers and they stand a chance to either be scouted for by clubs or get college scholarships abroad,” said Ndebele. Apart from the Harvest in Sport tournament in December, Ndebele said the academy is also working on hosting two tournaments. “If everything goes according to plan, we will be hosting one or two academies here in Bulawayo. “It’s in the pipeline but the bottom line is that we’re trying to develop young players spiritually, physically as well as socially in order to enhance the spirit of Ubuntu on and off the field,” said Ndebele He said their Under-18 side is affiliated to the Zifa Division Two league. “The Division Two league acts as a practice ground for what they are taught at training. Recently we sent Under-18s for trials in Harare and they made it into the top four where the first two got consideration and a trip sponsorship to the United States. Funds permitting, they will be on their way to the US soon,” Ndebele said. “We are appealing to well wishers to help buy air tickets for the boys. We founded this academy in 2015 with Marvellous Bonsai and donations from well wishers have kept it going,” said Ndebele, who also coaches the Bulawayo Polytechnic women’s soccer team. — @DecoDecent2
