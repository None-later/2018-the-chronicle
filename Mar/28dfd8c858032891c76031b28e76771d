Yemurai Ushamba, Chronicle Reporter THE United States has availed $750 000 to fight human trafficking in the country for the next three years. This was said by the United Nations International Organisation for Migration (IOM) Chief of mission in Zimbabwe, Mrs Lily Sanya at an event to mark the beginning of a training session for IOM officials in Harare recently. “The funding from JTIP will enable IOM to implement various counter trafficking activities in collaboration with the Government of Zimbabwe,” she said. “Over a three year period, IOM will work to enhance government and civil society’ efforts to coordinate anti-trafficking responses, and protect victims of trafficking.” She said this will be achieved through strengthened protection to identified victims of trafficking and improved capacity of targeted communities to prevent trafficking in persons. U S Ambassador Harry Thomas Jr commended IOM staff for attending the three day training session. “It is a top priority of the United States to eradicate this global scourge in the 21st Century and to protect societies that have become the targets of exploitation,” he said. The ambassador also said the most recent report of June 2017 by IOM shows that Zimbabwe has made notable progress to strengthen its capacity to respond to cases of human trafficking in 2016. The Director of Social Welfare in the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, Mr Tuso Mapala, said the Zimbabwean Government was in the process of establishing centres in all provinces to rehabilitate victims of human trafficking. “Under the protection pillar the ministry had the mandate to provide protection services for the victims of human trafficking as they are rendered vulnerable,” he said. — @Yushamba
