Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter FEMALE footballer Pamela Zhuwao (25) of Zim Scorpions, who tragically drowned at a Bulawayo lodge swimming pool on Friday night, will be laid to rest in Norton today. Zhuwao was the Zim Scorpions’ goalkeeper, a women’s football team based in Mhondoro and sponsored by Ngezi Platinum. She drowned in the lodge’s swimming pool minutes after the team’s arrival in Bulawayo for a pre-season tour. Zim Scorpions manager Rumbidzai Muyambuki was still devastated yesterday while narrating the tragic event of Friday night. “When we got to the lodge, I was shown the rooms as the team manager and I in turn showed the girls their rooms. Soon after that, the girls requested to shower. While they were showering, I understand Zhuwao went out and threw a floating balloon into the pool after which she jumped onto it. The balloon had little pressure and sank, resulting in her drowning, as she didn’t know how to swim. Unfortunately, the pool is some distance from the rooms and no one heard any screams for help,” said Muyambuki. “When the other girls finished showering, they saw her struggling in the pool and we rushed to try and rescue her. “When she was taken out of the water, she was bleeding from her nose and mouth. She was quickly rushed to the nearest hospital, but unfortunately, she was pronounced dead on arrival. “She was a great person who was very involved in the development of women’s soccer. It’s a pity that she had to go in such a painful way. “She was a great person and those who know her will testify to that. We are still in shock; she was a great goalkeeper who had made a name for herself in football circles. I believe we have been robbed of a great player,” Muyambuki said. Zim Scorpions was supposed to play four friendly matches against Bulawayo sides Burrow Jets, Sojini, Street Set and Ubuntu at Matabeleland Busters grounds at the weekend.
