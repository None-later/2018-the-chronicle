Former Highfield National Assembly representative Psychology Maziwisa and former ZBC news anchor Oscar Pambuka were yesterday jailed for six-and-a-half years for duping Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) of over $12 000 after claiming to have done publicity work. They will, however, serve an effiective three-and-half years after part of the sentence was made to run concurrently. Their jail term could be further reduced by another year if they restitute ZPC $6 000 each by January 31, 2019. Magistrate, Mr Lazini Ncube, said the evidence provided in court showed that there was clear misrepresentation on the part of Maziwisa and Pambuka.
“The evidence given by the state shows that the two accused (Pambuka and Maziwisa) clearly acted fraudulently as they lied to Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) that they had done coverage and advertisements for when it is Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation’s mandate to provide coverage for all Government entities. “Fruitful Communications did not have a contract with ZBC and the two accused indirectly used ZBC to deceive ZPC. They have therefore been found guilty on both counts,” he said. <img class="wp-image-428003 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/PAMBUKA-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/PAMBUKA.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/PAMBUKA-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Oscar Pambuka Earlier in mitigation, the pair’s lawyer, Mr Jonathan Samkange had suggested that they be jailed three years effective. In respect of the second count, a custodial sentence would not be called for. What would be fair would be to sentence the accused persons to three years effective which would be suspended as follows: one year will be suspended on account that they restitute the $12 000 whereby they will be paying $6 000 each. “A further year is suspended on condition that they do not commit the same offence for five years and the last year can be suspended on account that they do community service,” he said. But prosecutor, Mr Michael Reza, opposed this saying that fraud cases are rampant and therefore it was imperative for the court to send a strong signal by giving custodial sentences to ensure that others with plans to do so are discouraged. “Your worship, crimes of this nature need one thing which I call the doctrine of the justice of fire. If one plays around with fire, then they are bound to get burnt. In the same light, anyone who commits fraud must be given a prison sentence. “What will be fair and just would be a prison sentence like the one that was given to former minister Samuel Undenge whose crime was linked to the accused,” he said.. After the sentence, Mr Samkange indicated that he will apply for bail pending appeal at the High Court.
