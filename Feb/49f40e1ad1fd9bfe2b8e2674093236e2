Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter EMERGING school of sporting excellence Mpopoma High School will tomorrow and Friday hold its inter-house track and field athletics competitions that will be used to select the school’s team for the inter-schools meet later this month. Competing under Mzilikazi district, Mpopoma High School has all along been known for its academic supremacy, but has in recent years been doing well in sporting activities as shown by its total dominance in last year’s inter-schools meet in which it managed to amass over 16 gold medals, well ahead of closest rival Northlea High, which got just five gold medals. “We are all set for our inter-house competition, which will be held at the school grounds on Thursday and Friday. “We would have wanted to hold our event at White City Stadium, but we understand it’s undergoing renovations,” said the school’s sports director James Rugwevera. The school has four houses, Sivako, Chigumira, Mthimkhulu and defending champions Ingwenya. “Besides our track being substandard in terms of distance, we are confident of producing top quality athletes because it’s all in the training,” said Rugwevera. The Mpopoma High track is 100 metres short due to limited space. Mpopoma High provided 21 athletes to the Bulawayo Metropolitan provincial athletics team last year, the largest number from a single school. @skhumoyo2000
