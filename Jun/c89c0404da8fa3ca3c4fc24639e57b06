Thomas Sweswe Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Football Union of Zimbabwe (FUZ) has called on out-of-contract players to attend their training camp which started on Thursday and ends on July 5 in Harare so that they are considered for a four-team tournament in Botswana next month. Former national team and four-time Premiership winning coach with Dynamos Callisto Pasuwa and ex-Shabanie Mine gaffer Takesure Chiragwi have been assigned the responsibility of assembling the local side that will compete with their Botswana counterparts. Thomas Sweswe, the FUZ secretary-general who also played for ex-national team, Kaizer Chiefs, Dynamos and Highlanders, said the out-of-contract players’ training camp is meant to assist participants secure clubs during the July transfer window. “We have registered a low number than we had anticipated and we have resolved to keep the registration open. We wish we could make it a national tour but our coffers are dry. We are therefore calling on those who can make it to Harare to come and try their luck,” said Sweswe. He said in the past some players have been invited for trials by different clubs after such tournaments. Sweswe said he hoped some of the players who will be identified for the tournament to be held in Botswana from July 6 to 8, will also get clubs in Botswana. “This exercise will not only help players secure teams in Botswana because we have also invited local clubs to come and scout for talent at our camp,” he said. Sweswe said the pre-season training camp is being held at the National Sports Stadium B Arena. Among the 16 players who attended the two training sessions are ex-Harare City and ZPC Kariba’s Osbourne Mukuradare, Charles Mukanaire formerly with Triangle, Munyaradzi Chiwara offloaded by Yadah, Beaven Diya (How Mine goalie) and ex-Dynamos’ Admiral Matope. — @ZililoR
