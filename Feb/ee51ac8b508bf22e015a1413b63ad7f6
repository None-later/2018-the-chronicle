Some of the more than a tonne of Zesa cables that were recovered at a house in Nketa 9. Nyaradzo Bakari, Chronicle Reporter THREE Bulawayo men have been sentenced to a total of 30 years in prison for stealing Zesa copper cables in Figtree last Friday. Albert Ndlovu (42) from Mpopoma suburb, Gift Soganile (29) and Thamsanqa Dube (22) both from Nketa 9 suburb, were convicted on their own plea of guilty to cutting, damaging or interfering with any apparatus or material made for generation or supply of electricity by Bulawayo regional magistrate Mr Joseph Mabeza. Mr Mabeza sentenced each of them to 10 years imprisonment. “In giving the sentence, the court considers that accused persons are first offenders. They pleaded guilty to the charge, therefore did not waste the court’s time. Accused one and two are family men. However, the offence attracts a custodial sentence. You planned for it and connived to commit it. You will each be sentenced to 10 years in prison,” said the magistrate. Prosecuting, Mr Simbarashe Manyiwa said the trio was arrested following a tip off to the police by a man, Mr Sailas Sibanda, who had given them a lift to a farm in Figtree. “On February 2 the accused persons teamed up and arranged to go and steal copper cables. They arrived at West Acre, Figtree at about 6 PM where they were offered a lift by Mr Sibanda who dropped them off at Bhazha turn off. Mr Sibanda became suspicious about the accused persons hence he monitored their movements,” he said. Mr Manyiwa said Mr Sibanda went to Figtree police station and reported his suspicions. He followed the trio with three police officers and caught them rolling copper cables they had cut from a Zesa pole on the farm. The prosecutor said the $2 500 worth of cables were 1,2m long and weighed 88,5 kg. @NyarieBakie
