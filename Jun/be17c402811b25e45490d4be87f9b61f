 Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BOSSO 90 handed Tsholotsho FC their first defeat of the season in the Southern Region Division One League, overcoming the former Premiership side 2-1 on a weekend that most teams played to goalless draws. A brace by midfielder Denzel Khumalo powered Bosso 90 to victory and moved them up the table to eighth from 11th with 13 points off nine games. Tsholotsho scored through Tinashe Mthimkhulu, but still dropped down the table into third place, two points behind Hwange on 18 points. Hwange were held to a 0-0 draw by Main Line at Dingumuzi Stadium in Plumtree. Joseph Sibindi, the Tsholotsho coach, felt the defeat by Bosso 90 was a wake-up call for his charges. “Over confidence by the players had an effect on our game. It’s good for players to be confident, but I think they failed to manage that confidence and at the end of the day Bosso 90 beat us. What is crucial now is to recover from this defeat and work on our shortcomings,” said Sibindi. Bosso 90 coach Melusi Sibanda, who missed the team’s game as he had travelled with Highlanders’ first team for the away Premiership encounter                 against Harare City leaving Gift Lunga Jr, praised his charges. “We lost a number of players at the beginning of the season, with most going into the first team, and it is good to see that the team has started gelling. Credit goes to the boys who are developing and gaining confidence with each passing game. Remember we’re not worried about results; rather our objective is to make sure that we nurture and produce players that will go into the first team,” said Sibanda. While Bosso 90 celebrated their victory, five games produced 0-0 draws. NRZ Leopards and Talen Vision shared the spoils in Dete, while Toronto moved two places from the bottom of the table into 14th with six points after holding CIWU. The other 0-0 draws were the Hwange derby between Moto Moto and ZPC Hwange, Makomo and Zim Leopards as well as the Main Line and Hwange game. Two walkovers were recorded at the weekend. Indlovu Iyanyathela were handed three points on a 3-0 score line after Casmyn failed to turn up for their fixture at Mzilikazi Barracks. Police side ZRP Bulawayo were walked over by Victoria Falls club Mosi Rovers after failing to secure a venue. According to Zifa Southern Region administrator Augustine Ndlovu, ZRP Bulawayo were supposed to curtain raise the Bulawayo Chiefs and Ngezi Platinum Stars Premiership encounter, but were denied access to the stadium after failing to book the venue. “They (ZRP Bulawayo) had told us that they spoke to Bulawayo Chiefs and agreed that they were going to be the main curtain raisers. We then told them to go and pay $100, which Bulawayo City Council charges for Division One games, but they didn’t do that. The local authority then declined them use of the facility and as such, they were walked over,” said Ndlovu.
