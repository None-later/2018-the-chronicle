 Mashudu Netsianda, Senior Court Reporter A BULAWAYO man who sneaked into a church building and stole more than $1 000 ran out of luck after forgetting his cellphone at the crime scene, a magistrate heard. Bulawayo magistrate Ms Gladmore Mushove heard this when Takudzwa Nhindiri (24) of Pumula North suburb appeared before her facing charges of unlawful entry and theft. He was remanded out of custody to February 12 for trial. Prosecuting, Mr Kudakwashe Jaravaza said on December 30 last year at around 8.30PM, Nhindiri went to Wealthy Word International Ministries in Thorngrove suburb and requested keys under the pretext that he wanted to collect a satchel and sports shoes from the church. He allegedly opened the main door of the church building and stole the money. “Soon after accessing the building, the accused person proceeded to the administration office where he used duplicate keys in his possession to open the safe,” said Mr Jaravaza. Nhindiri stole US$556, $669 bond notes and R1 210. “Accused person used duplicate keys to open the safe and stole cash in United States dollars, bond notes and South African rand,” said the prosecutor. Mr Jaravaza said Nhindiri forgot his cellphone in the office, which betrayed him. “Accused person forgot his Microsoft cellphone in the office when he walked out of the building,” said Mr Jaravaza. The court heard that Nhindiri’s gadget was recovered by one of the church members, Mr Calvin Dube, the following day. Mr Dube also discovered that church funds were missing from the safe. The matter was reported to the police and investigations were conducted leading to the arrest of Nhindiri and nothing was recovered. – @mashnets.
