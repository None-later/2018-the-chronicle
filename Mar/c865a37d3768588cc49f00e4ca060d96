Lovemore Munyamana Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Bulawayo Metropolitan Bodybuilding and Fitness Association (BMBFA) will hold its first event of the year, the Mr and Ms Western bodybuilding contest at Iminyela’s Imbizo Gym on Saturday. The competition will be used to select bodybuilders that will represent the province at the national Federation of Zimbabwe Bodybuilding  and Fitness organised Mr and Ms Novice set for Harare on March 31. Simon Gama, the BMBFA organising secretary, who also doubles up as provincial coach, said Saturday’s event is open to all bodybuilders, particularly from western suburbs’ gyms. He said participants will fight it out in four categories, senior men, junior men (Under-23), men’s physique and women’s beach bikini. “This is an opportunity for bodybuilders from the western areas to come and showcase their talent. This competition is open to first timers, those who have never been on stage in any competition. “Bulawayo has always been known as the hub of bodybuilding and we hope that the top three we select in each category will represent the province with honour and raise our flag at the national competition,” said Gama. At last year’s Mr and Ms Novice, Bulawayo’s representatives did fairly well, with Marvelous Ganda coming second in the men’s physique category and Temba Langa emerging second in the bodybuilding category. Tapiwa Zimanda was the first runner-up in the junior men. Meanwhile, five Bulawayo bodybuilders, Shantel Greenland (Ms Zimbabwe holder), national Under-23 women’s champion Selina Manuel, Mr Zimbabwe lightweight Lovemore Munyamana, Ganda and Pardon Dube will represent the country at the Arnold Classic Africa competition set for South Africa next month. @ZililoR
