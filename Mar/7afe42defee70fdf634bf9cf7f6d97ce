 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter ALL is set for the Basketball Union of Zimbabwe (Buz) annual inter-provincial competitions set for Marondera during the Easter holiday. The two day competition will roar into life on Saturday and end the next day. The association will use this month’s tournament to select national Under-18 teams for the Afro-Basketball qualifiers in Mozambique in May. Buz president Joe Mujuru said: “We are ready to host this year’s inter-provincial tournament in Marondera. We are excited with the prospect of having a tournament of this magnitude for the first time in Mashonaland East. “As Buz we are on an expansion drive of taking basketball beyond Bulawayo and Harare so being in Marondera is a step in the right direction. We are looking forward to an increase in the number of teams participating in the tournament. “This tournament will be used to select the best Under-18 players from all provinces to be part of the national team that is going to travel to Mozambique in May. All provinces should ensure they send teams so that their players are considered for selection.” From the country’s 10 provinces Matabeleland North, Mashonaland Central and Matabeleland South are the only provinces yet to confirm participation. Meanwhile, the Bulawayo province team is expected to leave for the tournament on Friday. Sinda Mono heads the Bulawayo province’s technical team, with the senior men’s team head coach being Theo Weale of Highlanders and Mxolisi Ndlovu taking charge of the women’s side. The Under-18 girls’ head coach is Mthulisi Makhosana assisted by Lerule Smith, while Jonah Vumah will take charge of the boys’ team assisted by Simba Mbengegwi.
