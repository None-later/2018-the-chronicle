 Tendayi Kasamba, Chronicle Reporter THE Meteorological Services Department (MSD) has predicted more rainfall in most parts of the country with the possibility of localised heavy downpours. This comes at a time when hope had been lost among farmers with fears of a drought that seemed to be imminent. Last month, about 30 percent of the country’s crops were said to be a write off due to the prolonged dry spell that has hit the country. Agricultural experts were dispatched on a national crop assessment drive to ascertain the food security situation in the country following the dry spell. The government has, however, urged Zimbabweans not to panic over the dry spell witnessed in some parts of the country, saying the nation had adequate grain reserves to sustain the affected communities. In a statement on Tuesday, the MSD said rainfall, accompanied by thunderstorms, is expected to persist in most parts of the country. “Rain and thunderstorm activity is expected to persist in Matabeleland North Province, all Mashonaland Provinces, Harare Metropolitan Province, Manicaland Province and some northern parts of the Midlands Province with localised heavy downpour still remaining a possibility,” the MSD said. The forecast comes against the backdrop of isolated rain showers and thunderstorms that occurred across the country on Sunday. “On Sunday some isolated light rain showers and thunderstorms occurred across the country. “The highest falls recorded being 37mm at Nyanga, Arcturus (Goromonzi) 28mm, 17mm at RG Mugabe International Airport and 13mm at Plumtree,” said the MSD. It urged the public to regularly follow weather forecasts in order to avoid any inconveniencies. In light of the warning on heavy downpours, the Met Department urged communities in low-lying areas to move to higher ground.
