Dominic Chungwa Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Caps United hitman and 2017 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League Golden boot winner Dominic Chungwa marked his debut in the Absa Premiership in South Africa with a goal that helped his Polokwane City side share the spoils with Soweto giants Orlando Pirates on Saturday. Chungwa was handed a start and scored the opening goal of the match in the 18th minute with a volley from close range. However, Pirates equalised at the death through Lyle Foster to squeeze a point. Chungwaâ€™s countrymen Walter Musona and George Chigova also started for Polokwane City on a day that Zimbabweans stole the show in the Absa Premiership. Ovidy Karuru and Khama Billiat were both on target for AmaZulu and Mamelodi Sundowns. Karuru scored the second goal as AmaZulu shocked Supersport 2-0 at King Goodwill Zwelithini Stadium to move off the relegation zone. Kingston Nkatha and Onesimo Bhasera were in the losing Supersport side, while former Tsholotsho midfielder Butholezwe Ncube featured for AmaZulu. Billat was on target as Sundowns hammered Platinum Stars 3-0 to cement their place at the top of the league table and remain on course to wrest the title from struggling champions Bidvest Wits. @skhumoyo2000
