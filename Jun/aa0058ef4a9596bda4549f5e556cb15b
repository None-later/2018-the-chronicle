Khanyile Dlamini Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter KHANYILE Dlamini has been appointed the first female National League chairperson of the Zimbabwe Volleyball Association (ZVA). The National League chairperson is a constitutional requirement and the person also sits on the ZVA board. Leadership posts in volleyball have been male dominated and Dlamini has broken that glass ceiling. Dlamini is a holder of the FIVB Level 1 coaching certificate and a sports science degree. She has coached and managed teams such as Highlanders Ladies and the Bulawayo Youth Games volleyball teams. She was also part of the Zone VI Club Championship organising committee, which was held in the country in December last year. At the time of her appointment, Dlamini was coaching the National University of Science and Technology men’s volleyball club. Dlamini was elated with her appointment. “I’m very delighted with the appointment and I’m looking forward to the job ahead. A lot of work has been done by my predecessors, so I can only add from there. Volleyball is now being played in all provinces, thanks to the efforts of those who have come before me. The next step is to have the game being watched by the masses. This is key to attracting partners and sponsors,” said Dlamini. “Volleyball is a sport with a lot of potential to grow and raise the nation’s flag. I see volleyball as one of the sports our nation can be known for. In the next few years, I want to see sports ambassadors or flag bearers coming from volleyball. We are already heading in that direction with our men and women currently champions of the Sadc Region. If we keep this up, we definitely will be a strong volleyball nation,” she said.
