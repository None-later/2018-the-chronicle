Richard Muponde, Plumtree Correspondent BULILIMA District does not have a district hospital and is therefore forced to refer its patients to Plumtree District Hospital, the Member of Parliament for the area has said. Bulilima East MP Cde Mathias Ndlovu said the district is unlike its neighbouring Mangwe which can refer patients to St Annes Brunapeg. Bulilima’s big clinics are Ndolwane and Ntoli and if patients cannot be attended to by these  clinics, they are referred to Plumtree District Hospital. Some villagers, Cde Ndlovu said, were travelling up to 100 kilometres to seek services at Plumtree District Hospital. He said the worst affected were expecting mothers when they experience complications during delivery. Cde Ndlovu said the situation has been worsened by the poor state of the roads in the  district. He said Government promised a long time ago to build a district hospital but nothing has materialised. “I have been on record and very angry talking about this and even went to the extent of approaching the Ministry of Health and Child Care permanent secretary (Retired Major -General Gerald Gwinji) on the need for a District Hospital in Bulilima. I have said we cannot rely on mission hospitals like Brunapeg and Ndolwane Clinic which are owned by churches”, said Cde Ndlovu. He said the district was supposed to have five doctors but at the moment does not have a single doctor. “Imagine an ill person or expecting mother from Huwana area transferred to Plumtree travelling more than 80 kms on a bumpy road for about two and half hours. Sometimes there are no ambulances and most areas do not have buses,” he said. Bulilima West legislator, Cde Lungisani Nleya said Government must build a district hospital at either Masendu or Madlambuzi. Last week at the official opening of Bango Clinic in Mangwe District, the Minister of Heath and Child Care, Dr David Parirenyatwa, said health institutions should be as close as possible to the people. @richardmuponde
