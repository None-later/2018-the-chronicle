 Lisa Mangena, Court Reporter A 22-YEAR-OLD woman has been remanded in custody for theft. Chenjerai Mzadzi pleaded guilty before Western Commonage Magistrate Mrs Tancy Dube. Prosecuting Mrs Memory Ndlovu told the court that Mzadzi stole $200 from her employer Mrs Anele Mpofu. “Upon the complainant’s arrival from the rural areas, she found her maid absent. She proceeded to her bedroom where she noticed some money was missing,” said Mrs Ndlovu. “She had kept the money in one of her drawers in the bedroom,” she added. Mrs Ndlovu told the court Mrs Mpofu tried to call Mzadzi but her number was unreachable. “She only suspected her maid because that weekend she had left her alone at the house,” said Mrs Ndlovu. The court heard Mrs Mpofu noticed Mzadzi’s bags were not in her bedroom and she concluded that the maid had fled after stealing the money. The matter was reported to the police and investigations were made. Mzadzi was found at her homestead in Rusape by police and was kept in custody awaiting trial. — @LissahMangena
