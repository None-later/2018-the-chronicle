Tendai Ndoro THE Premier Soccer League (PSL) has announced its decision to appeal the ruling by Judge Denise Fisher to reinstate Ajax Cape Town back into the Absa Premiership. After the National Soccer League (NSL) board of governors held a meeting yesterday, the soccer body, at a press conference, announced it had approved a decision to appeal, while also confirming that the league is set to kick off on the first weekend of August. “We had a board meeting and we reached a unanimous decision that no matter what happens the league will start on the August 3/4,” Irvin Khoza, the PSL chairman said. “We are still appealing the decision made by Judge Fisher to set aside Advocate (William) Mokhari’s decision,” he added. The PSL’s legal advisor said Judge Fisher’s decision was simply wrong because Tendai Ndoro’s transfer to Ajax Cape Town was via the international route. “We have been proactive and have asked for an urgent date to have this matter heard in court before the league starts next month. “We haven’t discussed the final log standings and play-offs just yet because the legitimacy issue needs to be sorted out first,” Khoza added. Judge Fisher set aside the ruling by Safa arbitrator Mokhari and ordered that Ajax should regain their PSL status. Fisher referred the eligibility of striker Ndoro, over which Ajax had effectively been relegated, to the Fifa Players Status Committee. The PSL’s executive committee met in Parktown on July 5 to discuss the way forward with the matter now set to go through another appeals process. — Sport24
