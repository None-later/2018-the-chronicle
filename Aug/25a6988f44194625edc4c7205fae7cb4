Christo Potgieter and Kundanji Kalengo Mehluli Sibanda, Senior Sports Reporter SOUTH African Christo Potgieter claimed his second Safeguard Zimbabwe Open Squash Championship men’s title with a 3-0 win over Zambian Kundanji Kalengo in the final at Suburbs Squash Club yesterday. In one of the most one-sided finals in years, the 31-year-old Potgieter, winner of the top prize at the same competition in 2016, won 11-3, 11-3 and 11-5 to walk away with $1 000 in prize money, while Kalengo took $500. Potgieter came into the tournament as the top seed and never disappointed, while for the South Africa-based Kalengo it was a huge achievement to reach the final since he was seeded 10th at the tournament that started on Friday. Nigerian Yemisi Olatunji successfully defended her women’s title by beating her younger sister Busayo 3-1. Yemisi walked away with $750 and Busayo took home $500. Potgieter partnered with his compatriot Jimmy Schebusch to overcome the local pair of Neil Nesbitt and Mike Burns 3-1 in the doubles final. It was a repeat of the 2016 final which was also won by the South Africans. In the absence of Potgieter and Schebusch last year, Burns and Nesbitt won the doubles for the 13th time. The South Africans pocketed $500, with the losing finalists getting $300. Paul Chanda defeated fellow Zambian Felix Chilufya 3-1 in the veterans’ final to walk away with the $300 first prize, while Chilufya picked up $150. Isaiah Mpofu, the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation deputy director for Bulawayo presented the prizes to the athletes together with Safeguard managing director Warren King. @Mdawini_29
