Ricky Zililo, Sports Reporter TWENTY-SIX players have registered for the second edition of the two-day Bulawayo Chess Association (BCA)’s arbitration and coaching workshop that starts at Nust today. A training clinic precedes the BCA Easter Open tournament to be held at the same venue on Sunday and Monday. The clinic, targeting primary and secondary school teachers, comes a month after BCA held a similar programme that had over 100 participants. The workshop is meant to prepare participants for an international certification by the World Chess Federation (Fide). The BCA publicity secretary said registration closes today. Registration fee for the tournament that has five sections – Open and Ladies ($5), Junior A (Form 4 to 6) and Junior B (Form 1 to 3) is $3 and development (Grade 7 going down) is $2.  — @ZililoR.
