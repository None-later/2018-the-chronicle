THE Bantu Academy will be holding a United States of America (USA) Showcase trial session targeting Under-18s and Under-21s at Crescent Sports Club in Bulawayo tomorrow. Academy administrator Lindokuhle Ncube said the aim is to develop players in critical areas such as technical and tactical skills to help them reach their highest levels in soccer. “The intended objective is to see these youngsters make informed decisions and transition to sustainable career paths. “The Academy also insists on striving for excellence in both academics and sports, the development of skills and values that transcend sports as well as fostering a culture of giving back to the community,” said Ncube. Ncube said in a bid to ensure that they offer student athletes growth and exposure, the academy has invited international soccer coaches to come and conduct the session in order to ascertain who has both academic and athletic excellence. Players who will impress stand a chance of getting USA scholarships for prep school and college as well as joining professional teams. The Bantu Academy is a local youth development club with a track record of success. Since 2008, nine players have earned scholarships to the United States, 10 players have signed with professional teams in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Belgium. The academy has top coaches such as Agent Sawu, Dumaza Dube and Methembe Ndlovu. — @khumzallen
