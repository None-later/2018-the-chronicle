 Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls ONLINE registration for the 2018 Econet Victoria Falls Marathon has closed and local registration will be done from June 29-30. The marathon comprises the 42.2km full marathon, 21.1km half marathon and 7km fun run and will be held on July 1 in the resort town. The race starts from Zimpost Car Park, proceeds to the Victoria Falls Border along Livingstone Way, briefly crossing the bridge between Zimbabwe and Zambia and back. It then goes through the Zambezi National Park and finishes at Victoria Falls Primary School. Online registration numbers could not be established yesterday, but 2 700 runners took part in the marathon in 2017; an increase of 500 from the 2016 figures. Zambian Mathews Mutanya won last year’s marathon in a time of two hours 21 minutes and 32 seconds to end Zimbabwean runners’ dominance. Mutanya had finished third in 2016. Four-time winner Nkosiyazi Sibanda of Blanket Mine and Black Rhinos’ Millen Matende will be among the men to watch if they registered for this year’s edition. In the female’s category, veterans Tabitha Tsatsa, Samukeliso Moyo and Chiedza Chokore should seek to stamp their authority. @ncubeleon
