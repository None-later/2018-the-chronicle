 Thandeka Moyo, Chronicle Reporter BISHOPS in Bulawayo have urged Zimbabweans to remain peaceful and not be used to perpetuate violence during the post-election period. Their message follows the death of three people in violent disturbances in Harare on Wednesday. In a statement yesterday, Reverend Sikhalo Cele, the spokesperson for bishops, appealed to all Zimbabweans not to resort to the use of force as a means of resolving electoral disputes. Bishop Cele said all church leaders should call upon citizens to exercise restraint and avoid damaging any property. He implored people to value and protect human life. “The violence that has occurred in some areas of Harare has left some people hurt and lives lost. We do not want anyone to be hurt in anyway by what is happening,” said Bishop Cele. “We express our heartfelt and deepest condolences to the families of those members of our society who have died during the protest. We understand the anxiety of our communities as they await the announcement of the final results.” He said all Christians should take time and pray for peace and facilitate peace dialogues in their respective areas. “We call upon security services to use peaceful means of controlling any protest and ensure that no life is lost. All political party leaders should engage in constructive dialogue and restrain their members from engaging in any violent behaviour,” said Bishop Cele. “We recognise that the longer it takes for the final results to be announced, the more unsettled the country will become. We urge Zec to do whatever is in their power to expedite the release of the results.” —@thamamoe
