John Nyikadzino Lovemore Zigara in Gweru PREMIERSHIP debutants Nichrut will be home away from home when they face league returnees Mutare City at Mandava Stadium this afternoon. Nichrut who had opted to use Ascot Stadium as their home ground for this season were forced to use Mandava after the First Instance Board condemned the stadium. Despite playing their home match in Zvishavane, “Mushonga unouraya ipapo ipapo,” as Nichrut is affectionately known, they believe they can put the stadium issue behind and collect their first set of points when they face off with the Mutare-based side. Nichrut gaffer, John Nyikadzino, whose mission is to survive relegation, said it is important that his side picks as many points in the first half of the season for them to maintain their Premiership status. “Of course, we would have wanted to play at Ascot Stadium which is closer to Shurugwi, which would have meant our supporters came in their numbers. Nevertheless, Mandava is not a bad choice either and we are confident of putting up a performance and come out with maximum points,” said Nyikadzino. “Our objective for this season is to survive relegation and it is imperative that we use home advantage to collect maximum points. We would want to start on a positive note and I hope we get a result against Mutare City so that it gives the boys confidence going into the next game,” he added. Nichrut has a largely unchanged side from which did duty in the Zifa Central Region Soccer League with only a few additions to the team among them former Tsholotsho man Ocient Ncube and ex-Triangle United as well as ex-Hwange’s Tonisani Sibelo. Most of their players were drawn from Division One clubs in the region. Nyikadzino will also be hoping that he finds a trusted gunslinger after losing Jacob Muzokomba who joined Zifa Eastern Region Division One side Manica Diamonds. — @lavuzigara1
