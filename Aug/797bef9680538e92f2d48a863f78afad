Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter AN unidentified male biker died in an accident involving a car along the Airport Road in Kingsdale suburb in the early hours of Sunday. Police are appealing to members of the public missing a relative to come forward and identify the body of the biker who died near 747 Leisure Spot. A source that preferred anonymity said the victim who did not have any form of identity or wallet on him, was apparently only found with an old pair of a woman’s underwear in his pocket. Police arrested the driver of a silver grey Toyota Hilux, Admire Moyo (31) of Nkulumane suburb in connection with the accident. Moyo who was driving to his rural home in Inyathi when the accident occurred at around 3AM on Sunday is being charged with culpable homicide. The biker was heading into the city centre. Bulawayo Metropolitan Province Chief Inspector Precious Simango confirmed the fatal accident. “The suspect was driving along Bulawayo- Nkayi Road near 747 Leisure Spot due north with two passengers on board. As he approached a sharp curve, he encroached into the now deceased’s lane, resulting in a head on collision. “The unidentified deceased person sustained serious head injuries and died on the spot,” she said. Chief Insp Simango said the deceased is suspected to be between the ages of 30-36. His body was ferried to United Bulawayo Hospitals mortuary. However, in an interview Moyo said the biker who was coming from the opposite direction, heading towards the city centre was the one who encroached into his lane. @winnie_masara
