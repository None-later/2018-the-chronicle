Zimbabwe Cheetahs players, from left Tafadzwa Chitokwindo, Shayne Makombe, Stephan Hunduza and Kudakwashe Chiwaza Mehluli Sibanda, Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE national sevens rugby team coach, Gilbert Nyamutsamba, has named the final squad for the Sevens Rugby World Cup in San Francisco, United States of America, next week. The squad of 12 was named after a training camp in Harare last week and only speedster Tafadzwa Chitokwindo survived from the side that played in the last World Cup in Russia. Nyamutsamba said his selection was influenced by the future, hence the inclusion of young players in the squad. Shingirai Hlanguyo and Tarisai Mugariri are some of the youngsters that made the World Cup squad. United Kingdom-based Cheetahs captain, Hilton Mudariki, was not available for selection together with Tapiwa Tsomondo who plays rugby in South Africa. With Mudariki unavailable, Stephan Hunduza and Boyd Rouse were handed the responsibility to lead the team in the USA. “We are looking at life after the World Cup. The selection was, therefore, not only influenced by current form, but also continuity. Regular senior players still in good form had to make way for a new generation of players,” Nyamutsamba said. — @Mdawini_29.
