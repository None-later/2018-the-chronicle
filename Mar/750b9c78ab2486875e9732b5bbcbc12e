Mechanic Manyeruke Lovemore Zigara, Midlands Correspondent VETERAN gospel musician Mechanic Manyeruke is set to bounce back onto the gospel scene after a lengthy hiatus with the release of a new album titled Dzokororo. Manyeruke, who is affectionately known as Baba Manyeruke, has produced over 25 albums to date. His debut album Zakewu was released in 1984. The 76-year-old artiste, who shot to stardom with hit tracks such as Makorokoto, Arimo Mandiri and Moses Murenje, said the latest offering, to be released at the end of April, is a fusion of his old renditions and new songs. “I named my latest album Dzokororo (repeat) because I have redone some of my previous songs on this album which I believe many people will like because we reinvented our sound,” said Baba Manyeruke. “We also have new tracks which include Vakandichengeta Amai, a tribute to my mother for raising me. God willing, we want to launch this album at Meikles Hotel on 30 April this year,” he added. Manyeruke said soon after the release of the album, he will stage shows across the country as part of efforts to promote it. He also revealed plans to tour the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States of America. The revered gospel guru encouraged up-and-coming gospel artistes to come up with their own original compositions if they want to make an impact. “The challenge with today’s gospel artistes is that the aspect of originality is no longer there. Most of them are turning to church hymn books, (which is not a bad thing) but they should have their own original compositions which people can remember,” said Baba Manyeruke. @lavuzigara1
