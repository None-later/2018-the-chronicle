Donald Trump EDITOR — Zimbabwe needs to build economic structures that can withstand occasional foreign headwinds in the way of sanctions. The country needs to be resourceful and seek to reduce reliance on borrowing from IMF and World Bank. Evidence shows that development based on borrowing is nothing, but artificial. Withdraw foreign funds all that so called “development” simply collapses like a deck of cards. I suggest sanctions from the US should be viewed as a lesson to Zimbabwe, authorities must look inward for solutions. I think in many ways US is doing us a favour, we must rely on our own mettle. It hurts, but nothing comes easy, Zimbabweans can develop their country, if they put their hearts and souls to it, with US sanctions in place. We have an opportunity to prove our worth ladies and gentlemen. Spoon feeding can only go so far, Zimbabwe is ours not US territory, it’s up to us! — Panashe Marwizi.
