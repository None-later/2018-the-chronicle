ZIMBABWE Under-20 will put one foot in the semi-finals of the Cosafa Under-20 Championships in Zambia if they avoid defeat against Lesotho this afternoon. The Young Warriors got off to a winning start on Monday when they dispatched Botswana 2-1 through a brace by Triangle United, striker Delic Murimba. “We need a result against Lesotho and then hope that the other group fixture between Angola and Botswana on Thursday produces a favourable outcome for our cause,” said Young Warriors’ coach, Bekithemba Ndlovu. With Angola and Lesotho playing to a 1-1 draw in the other Group C encounter, the Young Warriors lead the group by two points and need to avoid defeat to remain in contention for a semi-final berth, as only the top sides from the three pools and best runner-up from Group A and C will sail through. Ndlovu said the midfield was crucial in their first game, especially when on the offensive. He is likely to deploy the same line-up that did duty on Monday in the hope of subduing the 2017 losing finalists. Lesotho were beaten 1-2 by South Africa in last year’s final. Zimbabwe wrap up their group games with a tie against Angola on December 9, while Lesotho take on Botswana. Both games will be played at Nkana Stadium. Winners of the group will clash with Group A winners. Group A has hosts Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi and guest nation DR Congo.
