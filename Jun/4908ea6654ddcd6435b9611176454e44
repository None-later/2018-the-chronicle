 Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE 2018 edition of the Bulawayo Community International (BCI) half marathon which was scheduled for White City Stadium today has been postponed to September. A member of the organising committee Themba Mhlophe said congestion of competitions in the month of June led to the rescheduling of the meet. “The preparations for the event have been going on well, however, we have been forced to move the dates after realising that there were a number of marathon events scheduled for the month of June. We have a big event like the Victoria Falls Marathon on July 1 so we have to give the athletes ample time to rest before we go for such an event. As the organisers of the meet remain hopeful that we will have a big event this year,” said Mhlophe. The event is a recognised international half-marathon that runs through Mpopoma, Sizinda, Tshabalala, Pelandaba, Magwegwe, Lobengula West and Njube suburbs. The race starts and ends at White City Stadium. Registration fees for the BCI marathon have been pegged at $10 for the 21km race and $5 for the 10km and 5km races. The event was started in 1995 by the Matabeleland North Athletics Board. The route was measured by the IAAF route marker in 1997.
