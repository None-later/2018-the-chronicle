 Yemurai Ushamba, Court Reporter A 17-YEAR-OLD boy from Emganwini suburb in Bulawayo will be caned for stealing $1 280 and R600 from his grandmother’s tenant. A court heard that the juvenile, who cannot be named for ethical reasons stole the money while in the company of his friend, whose age was not mentioned in court. The boy’s accomplice is on the run. The boy who lives with his grandmother was convicted on his own plea of guilty to theft by Western Commonage magistrate Mr Stephen Ndlovu. He was sentenced to three strokes to be administered by a prison officer. Mr Ndlovu said in sentencing him, he had taken into consideration that he was a juvenile. Prosecuting, Mr Mufaro Mageza said between June 30 and July 26 this year, the minor connived with his friend and gained entry into the complainant’s room which was unlocked. “The minor and his friend used a screw driver to force open the wardrobe door and stole cash amounting to $1 280 and R600,” he said. The court heard that the complainant asked other occupants of the house about the missing money and the minor admitted to have connived with his friend to steal it. The complainant had been handed the money by members of her club. The stolen money was not recovered. @YUshamba
