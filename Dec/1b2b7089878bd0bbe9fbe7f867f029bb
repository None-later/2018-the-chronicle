The Chronicle Response to “Heavy rains time to plant, farmers told”. Let’s hope the rains can sustain us through the whole season. – Majurumbwa Response to “ED meets Zim Diplomats”. Hope something positive came out of this meeting. — Manjonjo Response to “Raise presidential age limit: Women”. Let us work on improving our urban transport system and restore the law on our roads in addition to setting the Presidential age limit. — Progressive Zimbabwean Response to “First Lady calls for patient focused health delivery”. Thank you for the thrust in this field. There has been a slight change and eagerness to deliver at most health institutions although it’s still a long way to go as on my last recent visit to Parirenyatwa outpatient pharmacy some senior sister nurses were poking fun at all the efforts, hence these bad apples need to repent or be removed from the system. – Eliah Delta should keep track on bars and beer retailers because prices are rising by the day despite assurances by the company that they have not raised prices. They should regulate bars to cushion their loyal customer base from extortionate behaviour. – Disgruntled.
