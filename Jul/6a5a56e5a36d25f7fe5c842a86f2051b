Ephraim Chawanda Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter LEGENDARY former Zimbabwe national team skipper Ephraim Chawanda has called on football authorities to prioritise junior football development if the country is to do well in international tournaments. The Zimbabwe Under-17s put up a horror show in the Cosafa Cup in Mauritius where they were knocked out in the group stages following a 2-3 loss to Swaziland and 0-5 annihilation by Malawi. Chawanda said success does not come overnight, but needs proper developmental systems, which are not in place in Zimbabwe hence the embarrassment. “A house without a foundation always produces cracks at first and finally collapses. Football outcomes are all dependent on input. Zifa has to put up properly organised structures of junior football,” said Chawanda. This is the second time on the trot the Young Warriors have failed to progress beyond the group stages at the Cosafa Cup and the second time that Malawi has clobbered them 5-0. Last year the youngsters were under the tutelage of Moses Chunga, while Tafadzwa Mashiri is in charge this year. Calls have been mounting for Zifa to establish proper running national junior leagues that will act as a feeder to the age-group national teams. Others have also questioned the player selection criteria whereby trials are held and players from Harare-based academies flood junior national teams. Bulawayo has historically been known for its strong junior systems and successful junior leagues, with all teams in the Premier Soccer League having strong junior teams except for Bulawayo Chiefs. Following their demolition by Malawi, the Young Warriors have a dead rubber against Angola today.
