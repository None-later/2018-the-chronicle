Rising house/gqom musician, Bhadilah is over the moon after winning his first music award at the Glamour Awards held in Gweru last Saturday. Bhadilah was voted the best artiste in the Best Alternative category and outshone well established artistes; Tocky Vibes, Coco We Africa and Jazz Prosper. The Beitbridge-born artiste, who was nominated at this year’s RoilBAA awards but did not win, said he was glad that he has finally been recognised. “It feels great to win my first national musical award. I’m overjoyed because I have finally been rewarded for the effort I’ve put in my work over the years,” Bhadilah said. He said this year has been a good one for him after having been nominated twice and dropping tunes that have been getting airplay nationwide. “I feel blessed and would like to give all the credit to the Lord and everyone who is rallying behind me. The journey has not been so rosy but that hasn’t discouraged me .” To celebrate this special achievement, Bhadilah is set to release a house/gqom gospel song titled Nkonela Murena today. The track is in three languages TshiVenda, IsiNdebele and ChiShona so as to accommodate all his fans from around the country. “I know most of my supporters who push my brand are scattered all over the country so I’ve composed this song with them in mind.” To thank his music stable for the work they put in, Bhadilah has arranged a holiday in Durban, South Africa for them this month. As his music career is flourishing, Bhadilah is also excelling academically as he recently graduated at Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo Polytechnic with a National Certificate in Information Technology. — @mthabisi_mthire
