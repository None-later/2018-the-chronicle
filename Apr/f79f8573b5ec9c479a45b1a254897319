Ms Sibusisiwe Dube Thandeka Moyo, Health Reporter A 54-year-old Bulawayo woman is appealing to well wishers to help her raise $12 000 for an emergency brain tumour operation in India. Ms Sibusisiwe Dube from Gwabalanda suburb said she has battled the condition for two years and has lost sight in one eye. She has in the past five months struggled with watery fluids that are always dripping from her nose due to the tumour. Her ordeal has been worsened by the ongoing doctor’s strike which enters day 26 today as she cannot go for reviews. Ms Dube told the Chronicle that doctors from Mpilo Central Hospital confirmed that the operation which was scheduled for January this year cannot be done anywhere in the country. “I was diagnosed of pituitary adenoma – slow-growing tumours that arise from cells in the pituitary gland located at the base of the brain, just behind the eyes. “Unfortunately no health centre can help me in Zimbabwe and I was advised to seek medical attention elsewhere,” said Ms Dube. She said she can only afford to buy monthly medication to ease her constant pain. “I was given a quote for $12 000 by an Indian hospital where I intend to go. I hereby appeal to well wishers to help me restore my health.” Ms Dube added that her condition was deteriorating as sight in her other eye is getting poorer with each passing day. “I have failed to see doctors as they are on strike and nurses could not help me. My left eye is completely dysfunctional now and for the past month I cannot eat as I vomit everything I take in.” According to Ms Dube, the $12 000 includes treatment, medication and transportation. “I stay at 7068 Gwabalanda and I can be reached on +263774378249 or +263775049859. My bank account is ZB 4304539742200 and I have all documents to prove my diagnosis and quotation,” said Ms Dube. @thamamoe
