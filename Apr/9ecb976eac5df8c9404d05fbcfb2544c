 Codelia Mondela, Court Reporter A TEENAGER from Fort Rixon allegedly covered her cousin’s mouth while her 19-year-old boyfriend raped her. A court heard that the girl (17) feared that the 14-year-old cousin would report her for having sexual intercourse with her boyfriend; hence she agreed that her boyfriend should have sex with the minor. The two were not asked to plead to rape charges. Bulawayo regional magistrate Mrs Sibongile Msipa-Marondedze remanded them out of custody to May 22. Mr Robin Mukura said in November last year, the girl and her cousin were sleeping sharing the same blankets when the boyfriend joined them in the middle of the night. “The girl and the man had sexual intercourse while the minor was sleeping. She later heard them agreeing that the man should have sexual intercourse with her so that she would not tell anyone about the matter,” he said. “The girl covered her cousin’s mouth while the man mounted her and had sexual intercourse with her. After the act he went away. The matter came to light after some time when the minor’s parents noticed her behaviour change. They questioned her and she revealed the matter.” Meanwhile, a man from Plumtree has been ordered to perform 420 hours of community service for having sex with his minor girlfriend. The man (20) pleaded guilty to charges of having sexual intercourse with a minor. He said he did not know that she was 14-years-old as she had said she was 17. In passing sentence, Mrs Msipa-Marondedze said a fine was not an appropriate sentence since the man was not gainfully employed. She said community service was suitable as he would serve the community he had wronged. She sentenced him to 18 months in prison and suspended six on condition that he does not commit a similar offence in the next five years. The remaining 12 months were suspended on condition that he completes 420 hours of community service. @MondelaC
