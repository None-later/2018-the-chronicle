Kiyapili Sibanda, Showbiz Reporter THE rebranded Hustlers Nite Club now known as Club 09, failed to live up to its billing as it attracted a few at its official opening last Friday night. Club 09 is situated at the Monte Carlo Centre along Fife Street between 11th and 12th Avenue in Bulawayo. The joint is under new management made up of Zimbabwean investors living in Namibia. A few revellers who used to frequent the joint back in the days, turned up for the official opening. There were very few cars outside the club and it seems many people were not aware of its opening. People blamed poor marketing by the club management for the poor turn out at the official opening of the rebranded club which used to be very popular back in the days. The revellers who turned up said they expected a lot of improvements inside the club but that was not the case. The club manager Simon Gama said they did not expect the club to attract a full house on the opening day given that its January when people have a lot of commitments such as paying school fees. “Actually it was not a poor turnout but many people came very late. We were expecting that (low turnout) in January and we wanted to tell people that we are open so that they know that there is a new club in town. If we wanted a bigger crowd, we could have opened in December,” said Gama. — @Kiyaz_Cool
