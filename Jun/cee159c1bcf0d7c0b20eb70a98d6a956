Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter AMBITIOUS Hwange-based Southern Region Division One Soccer League side Makomo will have to keep their title hopes on track in the absence of head coach Rahman Gumbo who is in South Africa on national duty. Gumbo, a multi-Premiership winning coach will assist Sunday Chidzambwa when Zimbabwe battles to defend its Cosafa Cup title. The Warriors left the country on Thursday and will take on the winner of Group B preliminary round which features Botswana, Mauritius, Malawi and Angola in the quarterfinal. In the absence of Gumbo, Tapela Ngwenya will be in charge when they face Zim Leopards tomorrow in Hwange, hoping to bounce back to winning ways after last weekend’s shock 0-1 defeat to newcomers Moto Moto. Should Warriors progress to the semi-final, it means Ngwenya will also be in charge of next weekend’s away game at Casmyn. Ngwenya, who is familiar with leading the side in the absence of Gumbo having done so when Makomo were held to a 2-2 draw by Talen Vision on Week Two, said the absence of their head coach won’t affect their performance. “Our preparations for the game are going on well and the guys are raring to go knowing that we’ve to get back to winning ways so that we keep up with the chasing group. The absence of our coach won’t affect us because we know what we have to do and we’ll maintain the same system,” Ngwenya said. Makomo’s preparations for the game have been boosted by the return of striker Mike Chimombe and defender Elisha Zulu who missed last weekend’s games with knocks. However, they will have to do without midfielder Albert Machaka. Zim Leopards on the other end will bank on joint Nokel Security Southern Region Division One Soccer League May Top Goal Scorer of the Month Marlvin Dube and former Highlanders defender Benson Phiri who is linked with a move to Bulawayo City. Dube scored three goals in May and will share the accolade with Moto Moto’s Tatenda Ushe. Meanwhile, Talen Vision will also be hoping to bounce back to winning ways when they take on NRZ Leopards in Dete this afternoon following last weekend’s 2-1 away loss to Hwange. Vision were denied at least a point against Hwange who scored the winner deep in injury time when referee had reduced the away team to 10 players when he gave Nyasha Garayi a red card. Just like Vision, NRZ Leopards are a wounded lot having lost 0-1 away to Zim Leopards. A clash of the new boys is on the cards at Bulawayo’s Crescent Sports Club where CIWU hosts anchors Toronto and a potentially exciting clash is on this afternoon when Bosso 90 hosts Tsholotsho at Luveve Stadium. With the Highlanders senior team away to Harare City, the Bosso 90-Tsholotsho encounter promises to draw a good crowd. Tomorrow, ZRP Bulawayo and Mosi Rovers will be the main curtain raiser to the epic Premier Soccer League game between Bulawayo Chiefs and Ngezi Platinum Stars.
