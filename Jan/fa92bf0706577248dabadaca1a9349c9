FIRST Lady Cde Auxillia Mnangagwa Happiness Zengeni in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa yesterday vowed to lead Zimbabwe’s fight against HIV and Aids through distributing mobile clinics across the country and intensifying awareness campaigns. Speaking on the occasion of the 20th Organisation of African First Ladies against HIV/Aids (OAFLA) Ordinary General Assembly in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the First Lady said Zimbabwe had registered tremendous progress in the fight against HIV. The meeting ran from January 25 to 29 and came as African Heads of States also met in Addis Ababa for the Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the Heads of State and Government of the African Union on January 28 and 29. President Mnangagwa attended the AU meeting of Heads of State. “Personally, I undertake to champion the fight by going out there to the remote and disadvantaged areas with mobile clinics to improve access to health services,” said First Lady Mnangagwa. “I will also scale up awareness campaigns through mobilisation of critical stakeholders who include traditional leaders, the Chiefs and church organisation. “These will assist in conscientising communities on child marriages, child abuse and child survival.” This was her maiden appearance at the prestigious event after President Mnangagwa came into office late November last year. “I must emphasise that although I am new in my capacity as the First Lady of Zimbabwe, I am not new to issues around HIV/Aids, maternal child mortality and empowerment of women,” said Mrs Mnangagwa. “I am a Member of Parliament of a constituency for four years now, championing the transformation of the most vulnerable groups in our society.” Some of the initiatives she has spearheaded include establishment of women’s banks in her constituency, encouraging women to own livestock and raise school fees for their children and encouraging women to give birth in hospitals and not at home. She has also spearheaded building of mothers’ shelters for pregnant women to be closer to hospitals when they are due to avoid complications especially for the young women, gender equality programmes, abolishment of child marriages, pushing for strict jail terms for abuse of minors and rape, as well as provision of safe sanitary wear for young girls.
