 Sylvester Chiramba, Court Reporter A SIX-YEAR-OLD boy from Bulawayo was allegedly sodomised by a 20-year-old man who snatched him at a birthday party in Emganwini suburb. Desmond Chinengo, who had attended the same birthday party as the juvenile who cannot be named for ethical reasons, allegedly approached the boy and pulled him from the crowd before taking him to a nearby house which is under construction on Saturday. He allegedly assaulted the juvenile before sodomising him. Chinengo was not asked to plead to aggravated indecent assault charges when he appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Lungile Ncube. He denied committing the crime. “I admit being at the same party but I did not commit the crime,” said Chinengo “I have a small child at home and I pray that I be remanded out of custody so I take care of my child.” Mr Ncube remanded him in custody to today for trial at the Regional Court. Prosecuting, Mrs Memory Ndlovu told the court that on Saturday at around 8 PM, the boy was attending a birthday party at his neighbour’s house. “Chinengo was also at the birthday party. He approached the boy, pulled him from the crowd and took him to a nearby house which is under construction,” said Mrs Ndlovu. “The complainant tried to scream for help but Chinengo assaulted him. Chinengo forcibly removed the boy’s trousers and indecently assaulted him.” The court heard that the boy reported the matter to his parents and a police report was filed which led to Chinengo’s arrest. The juvenile was referred to Mpilo Central Hospital for medical examination and a medical report may be produced in court as evidence. @SlyCee10
