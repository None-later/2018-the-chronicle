 Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent SPAR Zimbabwe has opened another branch in Kwekwe bringing the number of its shops to 14 countrywide. The supermarket took over premises previously occupied by Dazzle Superstore and has benefited more than 70 youths who got employed by the supermarket. Speaking during the official opening ceremony, Kwekwe Mayor Councillor Matenda Madzoke said the new store was welcome in the mining town, which he said was open for business. “Kwekwe is open for business that is why you see business people coming to invest in this city. We welcome SPAR today and we hope we are going to have a good working relationship with them,” said Clr Madzoke. He hailed the company for considering employing locals. “I hear you have employed more than 70 people from Kwekwe, which is a welcome move as our children have benefited. If you have any problems, my office is wide open,” he said. SPAR Kwekwe general manager Mr Prosperity Mhangami said the supermarket will thrive to offer competitive services. “We will continue to offer competitive services as we boast of state of the art equipment and excellent service departments,” he said. He said customers had already warmed up to the new shop that opened its doors on June 1. Mr Mhangami said SPAR Kwekwe will also be directly involved with the community through various community programmes lined up. “We have a number of projects lined up for the customers and the community at large. For example, clean up campaigns and donations to orphanages as well as old people’s homes. We also have discounts for pensioners and our loyal customers,” he said. He said they are looking forward to recruiting more people to bolster their staff complement. SPAR Kwekwe becomes the 14th member of the SPAR Corporate Group owned by Darren Lanser.
