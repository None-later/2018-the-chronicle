Thanduxolo Nesbert Ndlovu Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter A VICTORIA Falls-based radio personality has broken into the international scene in fashion designing after being selected to direct a weeklong men’s fashion show in neighbouring Zambia. The first ever Zambia Men’s Fashion Week will be held between August 20 and 25 in Livingstone and will feature 10 Zambian and an equal number of international designers. Fifteen Zambian and seven international models will also take part. South African model Lunga Tshabalala and Bulawayo’s Shadel Noble will be part of the show alongside fashion designers, Wiseman Phiri and Baleke Gondwe from Zambia. Twenty-seven year-old Thanduxolo Nesbert Ndlovu, who hosts the mid-morning show on Victoria Falls’ Breeze FM station, said he was elated to be part of such a huge show alongside big names like Lephan Madida and Theresa Mishiba – Zambian media personalities. “This is the greatest feeling ever having people trust you with such a big project. It’s really a huge step and it’ll definitely open opportunities for me in the fashion industry,” Ndlovu said. He said he once tried his luck in modelling in 2010 and relocated to South Africa where he was exposed to more red carpet events thereby learning one or two things about fashion designing. Back home, he has worked with the likes of fashionista, Gilmore T Moyo who he said he respects as a mentor. The five-day fashion extravaganza, which is going to be the second biggest after the Zambia Fashion Week, is set to be an annual event, according to organisers. It will involve exhibitions and will be officially opened by Livingstone Mayor Eugene Mapuwo. The fashion week celebrates Zambia and Africa’s male brands in the fashion industry. It targets capable Zambian and African designers with interest to showcase their skills in eco-fashion, boost tourism as well as develop their skills to gain experience in the industry. @ncubeleon
