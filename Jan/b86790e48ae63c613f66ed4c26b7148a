Charles Manyuchi Tadious Manyepo, Sports Reporter FORMER world silver welterweight champion Charles Manyuchi says the pulling out of his principal sponsors, Mr T35, from boxing is a major setback for his progress at a time he is preparing to challenge for the title he lost in 2016. Mr T35, who have been bankrolling the sport in the country for the past seven years by investing over $300 000 over that period, anounced on Wednesday that they were pulling out due to financial constraints. And Manyuchi, who benefitted the most out of the company’s benevolence, yesterday lamented the development. “It’s a body blow to my boxing career to lose a partner like Mr T35. My career will never be the same again. This company played a huge part in transforming my profession for the better. “They have been there for me through thick and thin. I lived decently as a professional boxer due to the company’s benevolence. “Others have come in mainly because Mr T35 have shown a heart for my progress as a pugilist. “It is sad they have decided to pull out. I just hope that they will have a change of heart and decide to come back. I also understand that they have some financial problems emanating from the fact that they have not been cleared by the authorities to start assembling and supplying vehicles to Indian markets despite having been awarded the tender,” he said. During their time, partnering boxing, Mr T35 donated a new car each time Manyuchi went into the ring regardless of the outcome. It is the same company which made it possible for the 29-year old pugilist to travel for fights as he embarked on successful world adventures. Mr T35, along with Manyuchi’s Zambian promoters Oriental Quarries, hosted a memorable boxing fiesta at the Harare International Conference Centre where Machuchi knocked out Colombia’s Jose Agustin Feria inside 2 minutes and 42seconds.
