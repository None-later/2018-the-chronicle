 Sylvester Chiramba, Court Reporter A BULAWAYO man who was arrested for allegedly killing a man in Emthunzini suburb and throwing the body in a sewage pond in January this year walked free after the State withdrew the case against him due to lack of evidence. Mbonisi Ncube (36) from Emthunzini suburb, Umguza District near Pumula South, was facing murder charges when he appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Lungile Ncube yesterday. Mbonisi was out on $200 bail and the charge was withdrawn before plea after the State noted that there was lack of evidence against him. “The charges against the accused persons have been withdrawn before plea,” ruled Mr Ncube. It was alleged that Mbonisi killed Nkululeko Sibanda in Emthunzini suburb and threw the body in a sewage pond after suspecting that he was having an affair with his wife. For the State, Mr Petros Shoko alleged that on January 19 this year, Sibanda was drinking beer at Makoni Business Centre with his friends and Mbonisi. “Mr Sibanda left the accused at the business centre with the intention of going home,” said Mr Shoko. He said Mbonisi who suspected that Sibanda was having an affair with his wife, followed him and caught up with him at the sewage ponds. Mbonisi allegedly strangled Sibanda and threw the body in the sewage ponds, the court heard. The body, said Mr Shoko, was discovered after nine days. @SlyCee10
