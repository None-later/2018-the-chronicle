Thulani Sibanda Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter PREMIERSHIP newboys Bulawayo Chiefs are hoping that their players will be registered in time for Sunday’s Premiership match against former champions Caps United at Luveve Stadium. Chiefs pulled a stunner on their opening match of the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League season match against Yadah, drawing 2-2 with just two infield substitutes — striker Farawo Matare and defender Marlvin Mkolo  in Harare. The newly promoted side had 14 out of the 18 players they had taken to Harare for the Yadah match registered. Four players, strikers Dylan Chivandire and Hamadzashe Moyo as well as the midfield pair of Talent Mandizadza and Brighton Manhire had to watch from the terraces as their registration had not sailed through. On Sunday Chiefs face Caps United, with their technical analyst who doubles as the fitness trainer Thulani Sibanda hopeful of having more players for selection. Sibanda said they had to change their plans against Yadah after discovering while in Harare that licences for some of their players had not been processed. “We’ve been working on getting all our players registered. We were told that some of the players’ registrations were rejected by the transfer matching system and we are hoping that they will get their licences before the Caps United game. The boys fought hard for the point even though we felt that we could have returned to Bulawayo with full sets of points. “We’ve been working on our shortcomings. We just have to make sure that we are in the right mindframe, work on our endurance and make sure that we are tactically and technically stable when we face Caps United. It won’t be an easy game but we are ready for the challenge. The first games of the season are important in terms of shaping the direction that our campaign will take,” said Sibanda. Attacking midfielder Moses Majika and Perfect Chikwende were on target for Chiefs when they played against Yadah. Some of the Chiefs’ players waiting for their licences are Clement Makamba, Lucky Ndlela and Barnabas Mushunje. Players expected to drive Chiefs in their maiden season include goalkeeper Kelvin Nyoni, defenders Last Sithole who had a stint with Caps United, Polite Moyo, ex-Bulawayo City’s Andrew Tandi and national Under-20’s Shadreck Nyahwa. Gracious Muleya and skipper Kundishora Chakanyuka are some of the seasoned players at Chiefs. Sibanda has challenged his players to stand up and be counted in the Premiership. “We’re in the Premiership to compete and it is such games against big clubs like Caps United that players need to prove that they are equal to the task,” said Sibanda. He said he was aware that Caps United who played to a 0-0 draw against Harare City, will not be easy opponents as they search for a first victory.
