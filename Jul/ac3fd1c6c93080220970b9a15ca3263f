 A 27-year-old Lusaka youth has stormed social media with surprises after he posted a video of himself complaining that his teachers deceived him. In a nine minutes video clip, Robert Chikwanda says his teachers taught him things that do no apply in society. He says he is shocked that teachers were busy teaching him X + Y = 23 when all the formulas are not applying in society. Chikwanda feels that his parents have been robbed because not even bank accountants use the English of rewrite. “To all my teachers who taught me I’m taking you to court for robbing my parents money. You were busy teaching me rewrites in English, Starch, X + Y = 23 when none of the above is applying in society. In banks we don’t use rewrites. I feel you taught me things that you knew could not add value in society ” complained the youth. Yesterday he met two of his lawyers who agreed to help him deal with his ex-primary and secondary school teachers. “At first people thought he was joking but he is very serious, yesterday he consulted his lawyers,” said a close friend. — AP
