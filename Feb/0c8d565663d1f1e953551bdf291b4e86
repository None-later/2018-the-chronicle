 Codelia Mondela, Court Reporter A sales representative from Cold Chain Private Limited Company in Bulawayo has appeared in court for allegedly stealing more than $14 000 and submitting false invoices to cover up for the offence. Christopher Rukanda (30) from Montrose suburb and employed as a contract worker, is facing 53 counts of theft. He allegedly stole $14 687 and nothing was recovered. Rukanda was not asked to plead when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Sthembiso Ncube who remanded him out of custody on his own cognisance to March 21. For the State, Ms Tafadzwa Mutsambiwa alleged that Rukanda stole the money between August and November last year. She said Rukanda was assigned to sell stock in Matabeleland South and Masvingo provinces and was provided with a company car which had a monitoring and tracking system. Ms Mutsambiwa said Rukanda’s duties included selling stock to small scale traders and collecting payments. “From August 23 to November 24 last year, Rukanda delivered stock and collected payments from customers in the two provinces. Instead of remitting the collected money, he converted it to his own use,”, said Ms Mutsambiwa. She said to cover up for the offence, Rukanda created fake invoices as if customers were yet to pay for the delivered stock. — @MondelaC
