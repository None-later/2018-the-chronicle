Sithethelelwe ‘Kwinji 15’ Sibanda Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sport Reporter THE Zimbabwe Mighty Warriors have raised a red alert regarding their preparations for the final qualifier to the Total Women African Nations Cup encounter against Zambia as there are no clear indications on their preparations for the match. The first leg encounter is set for June 6 in Zambia and it will come when the Shipolopolo have been in camp for the last three weeks. “To be honest we are supposed to get into camp and prepare for our match against Zambia but as it stands we don’t even know when we will go for our preps. The coach has advised us that she still needs us to be part and parcel of the final qualifier but sadly we don’t even know when we will eventually go to camp,” said one player who has been very influential in the Mighty Warriors camp. Contacted for a comment on when they will troop into camp, Mighty Warriors coach and a legend in her own right Sithethelelwe ‘Kwinji 15’ Sibanda said she has submitted names of her preferred players to the leadership but remains unaware of when she will receive the signal to eventually start the training. “Naturally I would have wanted to have been in camp by now but we are not. Our opponents, Zambia have been in camp and preparing for us but alas, we are not in motion in terms of our preparation,” said Sibanda. To get to the semifinal stage, Zimbabwe beat first round opponents Namibia 4-0 on aggregate while Shipolopolo got  4-0  aggregate win having beaten Namibia 2-0 away and by the same scoreline at home.
