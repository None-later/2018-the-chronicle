The three-day festival is pencilled to run from September 28 to 30 at Great Zimbabwe. The Great Zimbabwe International Festival is being organised by the Great Zimbabwe International Festival Private Limited and will feature music performances, craft exhibition and a food festival. According to a statement from the organisers, the poems should be original and should go along with the theme: “Great Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe’s finest”. Winners of the competition in each category will receive prize money and will also be afforded an opportunity to recite their winning poems at the event. One of the organisers of the festival Tendai Mutsau said Andy Muridzo will be the headline act among other stand up comedians, poets, traditional and contemporary dancers. “Andy Muridzo is the headline act alongside Jah Signal, Guspy Warrior, Tererai Mugwadi, Trevor Dongo, Guspy Warrior, Dadza D, Mel B, Nina Grande, Mai Titi, Willis Wataffi, House of Stone, Pauline Gunduza, Mannex, Celcious and Extra Large,” Mutsau said. He said the festival was being held to promote destination marketing. “We want to increase the number of people who visit Great Zimbabwe through this festival. We want to show Zimbabweans and the world the importance of Great Zimbabwe which is the cradle of Zimbabwean history,” said Mutsau.
