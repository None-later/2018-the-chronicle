Southern Mavericks are top of the table with 25 points from 13 games and will fancy their chances of maintaining pole position with a victory. Mavericks coach, Liberty Nyathi, is confident of victory going into the fixture. “The boys are ready for the game and confidence levels are high in camp, so we expect to put up a brilliant performance on the court. We go into game expecting victory to extend our lead at the top of the table. “We are using every game as a platform to fine tune and polish up our tactics for National Championships. The expectation is that every player steps up their game and earn a place in the squad for the nationals,” said Nyathi.
