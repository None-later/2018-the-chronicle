FC Platinum defender, Kevin Moyo and winger Rahman Kutsanzira, will miss today’s Total Caf Champions League second-leg preliminary round clash against CNaps of Madagascar at Mandava Stadium. Moyo has a knee problem, while Kutsanzira has been complaining about pain in his ankle, according to coach Norman Mapeza. “They are both out of the tie,” said Mapeza yesterday. Moyo limped off during the Castle Challenge Cup against Triangle United at the same venue on Sunday, while Kutsanzira picked up the injury on the last day of the Premier Soccer League season against Highlanders at Barbourfields Stadium. The former Bosso skipper didn’t travel for the first-leg in Madagascar. Lawrence Mhlanga is expected to replace Moyo in defence and will partner tough as teak Gift Bello, with either Marshall Mudhewe or Gift Mbweti taking Kutsanzira’s place.
