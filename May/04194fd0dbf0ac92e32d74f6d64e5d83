Russell Mhiribidi Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter AT least 150 people have registered for an international sports management course organised by the Sports Leaders Institute of Zimbabwe (Sliz) in partnership with a Finland organisation Liike. The two-day seminar starts in Harare today at Msasa’s MTB. Sliz president Russell Mhiribidi said among those that have confirmed participation are former Dynamos’ left-back Stanley Chirambadare, who runs an academy in Harare, Castle Lager Premier Soccer league leaders Ngezi Platinum Stars, former Sables’ coach Cyprian Mandenge, ex-Zifa board member Benedict Moyo and sports directors from government and private schools. The programme’s topic is “Global trends in sport management and resource mobilisation”. “It is our hope that the participants will immensely benefit from the programme as we strive towards having a vibrant sports industry. Participants will be taught strategic management of sports organisations, which is basically commercialising sport. We’ll also cover financial management and resource mobilisation, media and sport development, running sport/physical education department and sports ethics and ethical decision making process. The response has been overwhelming and we have over 150 people that have registered. We expect more to register today,” said Mhiribidi. Course facilitator Ari Johannes Kouvi, the Liike executive director, is already in the country. @ZililoR
