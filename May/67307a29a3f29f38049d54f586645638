Lovemore Zigara, Midlands Correspondent TOP musicians Andy Muridzo, gospel prince Sebastian Magacha, Edith WeUtonga, Sam Dondo, Jazzy Jazz and Pastor Udzo Paradza are some of the artistes billed to perform at Gweru gospel artiste, Robson Vungania’s album launch at the Gweru Theatre tonight. Vunganai has invited these artistes whom he featured on his second album Ndezva Mwari, to grace its launch. This album comes hard on the heels of his debut album Tisvikewo released in 2016. Tisvikewo enjoyed relative success, especially in the Midlands province where it received massive airplay on 98.4 FM and YaFM – the province’s two metropolitan radio stations. “In 2016, I produced my debut album – a fusion of gospel music and jazz – and when it came out, although it was received well, some didn’t understand it because as far as gospel is concerned, people have categorised and given it a certain sound,” said Vunganai. He said the eight-track album is testimony of what God has done in his life.
