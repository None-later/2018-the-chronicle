 Richard Muponde, Plumtree Correspondent THE fire that razed a hostel at Plumtree High school three weeks ago could have been started deliberately, preliminary investigations have revealed. The outcome vindicates school authorities who insisted that the fire could have been act of arson to conceal theft at the two-storey Lloyd Hostel. A total of 120 pupils have been rendered shelterless by the inferno. Investigations discounted earlier claims that the blaze could have emanated from a faulty electric cable. Zesa Plumtree manager, Mr Victor Ndawana on Tuesday confirmed that the fire was not caused by an electrical fault. “We discovered that the fire was not as a result of an electrical fault but could be arson. During investigations we gathered that a staffer heard footprints of people upstairs before the fire broke out. However, I will not say much as I’m not allowed speak to the Press. You can get full details of our report from Bulawayo where I sent it,” said Mr Ndawana. Matabeleland South police acting spokesperson Assistant Inspector Loveness Mangena yesterday said police were still investigating the matter. Briefing Plumtree police officer-in-charge, Inspector Ginger Vhiyano who was leading a team of police officers at the scene when the building was burning, the school’s head, Mr Sipho Khumalo ruled out any electrical fault insisting he suspected arson to conceal theft. “I don’t think it’s an electrical fault because everything was intact. What I suspect is that someone could have stolen from the side where the fire started. That’s where all the pupils left their belongings going for school holidays. Someone could have set the building on fire to conceal theft,” said Mr Khumalo. @richardmuponde
