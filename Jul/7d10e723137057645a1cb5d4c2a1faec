 Michelle Gwizi, Court Reporter A MARRIED police officer has been dragged to the maintenance court by his ex-girlfriend who is demanding money for the upkeep of their two minor children. Ms Silethokuhle Nkomo was demanding $193 from Mr Unity Ndou for the upkeep of their two children but the court reduced it to $115. Ms Nkomo told the court that she is unemployed and Mr Ndou was not providing enough for the upkeep of the children. “He is a police officer earning $455 a month so he should be able to afford what Iam demanding,” she said. Mr Ndou however said he could not afford to pay the amount of money his ex-girlfriend was demanding. “I am offering $90 because I spend about $300 taking care of my immediate and extended family,” he said. Ms Nkomo rejected the $90 which she said was too little to meet the children’s needs. Bulawayo magistrate Ms Adelaide Mbeure ordered Mr Ndou to pay $115 with effect from this month. Last month another married police officer from Buchwa Police Station in Mberengwa was dragged to court by his ex-girlfriend also a police officer who was also demanding money for the upkeep of their minor child. Ms Rudo Moyo stationed at Fairbridge Police Station was demanding $100 a month from her ex-boyfriend Maxwell Togara but the court ordered him to pay $70. @gwizi_n
