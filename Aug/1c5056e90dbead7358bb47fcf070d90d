Jeys Marabini Showbiz Correspondent ALMOST half the venue has been filled up for Jeys Marabini’s album launch that will be held this Friday at the Bulawayo Theatre. Jeys is launching his ninth album, Ntunja Mbila, promising a night to remember for his fans in Bulawayo. Superstar Oliver Mtukudzi will be part of proceedings as Jeys’ guest on the night. Jeys is pulling all the stops as he has roped in renowned drummer Sam Mataure to be part of his band. One of Jeys’ protégés Hwabaraty will be part of the proceedings on the night. If the words by show promoter Zenzele Ndebele are true that 100 tickets have been bought for the 300 seater venue, then it means that fans have heeded Jeys’ call for them to support. “Tickets are moving well as people are buying them at a steady pace. “I believe that this week we can fill up the venue as they normally increase as the day for album launch draws closer,’ said Ndebele. Each ticket is going for $12 which includes Jeys’ album. Ndebele said everything looks on course for the day with sponsors jumping onto the bandwagon to be part of the album launch. “Orap has come in handy to sponsor through financial assistance. “They will be helping out to cover the costs for the band, venue hire, marketing and so forth. We thank them for coming through for the album launch,” said Ndebele. Jeys on the other hand is hard at work putting finishing touches to his performances rehearsing with the help of his band Kuzekulunge.
