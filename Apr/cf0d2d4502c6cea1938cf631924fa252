Nation Dube Tobias Mandoreba in Hwange HWANGE FC’s quest for a quick return to the Premiership comes under severe scrutiny when they clash with ambitious town rivals ZPC Hwange in an explosive Zifa Southern Region Division One league opener at Chakona Stadium on Saturday. The clash of the coalminers and the electricity generators is poised to be one of the main attractions of the weekend, as both teams have made their intentions of booking a Premiership ticket for next season. Hwange coach, Nation Dube, said that he is ready for war. “Hwange is well prepared for the ‘war’ on Saturday and we have mounted our ‘tanks’. I have a blend of experienced players and young boys that want to establish a name for themselves. I am aiming to come out tops at the end of season,” said Dube. His opposite number, Njabulo “JB” Dube, is also ready for the derby. “We are geared for this big game and our aim this year is to gain promotion to the elite league. We will fight tooth and nail throughout the season. It will be tough with Hwange and the likes of Tsholotsho around, but we are psyched up,” he said. Hwange retained players like goalkeeper Taimon Mvula, Gilbert Zulu, Gerald Ndlovu, Obert Moyo, Tendai Mate, Shepherd Gadzikwa, Andrew Chuma, Houdlacks Kaunda and Clayton Phiri. They also welcome the returning Malvern Longwe as well as ex-Bosso defender, Felix Chindungwe. ZPC Hwange still have seasoned campaigners, who include Morgan Nyoni, Israel Mkahanana, Harmony Nare, Alois Karidza, Bongani Dube and Shupani Ngwenya in addition to some new acquisitions. Meanwhile, Chipangano will unveil their 2018 squad at the Colliery Stadium this morning. @tobymandox
