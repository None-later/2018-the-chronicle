JOHANNESBURG — SuperSport United caretaker coach Kaitano Tembo is not eyeing the head coaching position at the South African Premiership soccer club, insisting he is merely a cadre on deployment. Tembo took charge for United’s goalless draw with Maritzburg United at Lucas Moripe Stadium on the weekend after Eric Tinkler resigned on Friday following a dismal run of results for the Tshwane giants. The former Zimbabwe and Dynamos defender also performed the role last term when Stuart Baxter was juggling his Matsatsantsa and Bafana Bafana duties. “For me, I am here to try to help and perform to the best of my ability and I think that’s the most important thing. I am like a cadre if you put it in political terms,” Tembo said. “Last season I did the same, so for me it’s not about the job, what is important is the team. I put the team first more than anything. “I am always there whenever I am needed to play my part and that’s what’s most important. The most important thing is the club. We need to make sure the club performs better, moves away from where we are in terms of our position on the log.” Tembo says he enjoyed a close relationship with Tinkler, who steered the side to MTN8 glory and the final of the Caf Confederation Cup in what has been a roller-coaster campaign for the relegation-threatened outfit. “Ja, I spoke to him (after the resignation). I know he is a good guy, we worked together, we were close. Yesterday we spoke but some of the things I will keep to myself. “Unfortunately, things didn’t work out but we won the MTN8 together, we got to the Confederation Cup final together. Things didn’t work out but at the end of the day he is a good coach.” SuperSport are three points above the drop zone with six games left. — Kickoff.com
