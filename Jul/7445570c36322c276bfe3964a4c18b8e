 A factory worker was killed when his workmate blasted compressed air up his rectum and ripped his insides to shreds. Yoshiyuki Yoshida (34) has been arrested by police in connection with the death of co-worker Akio Ishimaru (46) on Saturday, reports the Asia Times. The pair were messing around during a break at a manufacturing plant in Ibaraki Tsukuba City when Yoshida grabbed the air compressor, police said. It has been reported he then shoved it into his colleague, injecting his body with a powerful and lethal blast of air. A few minutes later, Ishimaru complained that he was not feeling too well. An ambulance was called which rushed him to the hospital but he died from his internal injuries. A Ryugasaki Police spokesman said: “It was a tragic accident but not the first of its kind. “The air compressor was pushed up against the anus, over clothing, not directly into the cavity. “The release of the air into the body probably damaged the lungs, causing death.” Yoshida, who has been charged with assault causing death, told cops: “I just did it as a prank.” And he added: “I didn’t think he could possibly die from that.” For a country free of guns and gun deaths, there has recently been a spike in deaths caused by air compressors, according to Asia Times. On December 16, 2017, two men working at an industrial waste disposal factory, in Saitama Prefecture accidentally killed their co-worker. The three men were using the air compressor to blow dirt and grime off of their uniforms, when they pranked their 44-year-old colleague by poking him in the rear with the air compressor. Both co-workers were arrested on charges of assault resulting in death. — The Mirror
