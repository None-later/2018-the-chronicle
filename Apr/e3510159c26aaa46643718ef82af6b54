Mthabisi Tshuma,Showbiz Reporter A GOSPEL show which was the talk of Gwanda last weekend as it served as a precursor to the famed Gwanda Gospel Festival failed to live up to its expectation after recording a low turnout. The artistes however, put up wonderful performances despite the poor turnout at Gwanda’s biggest church – Brethren Christ in Church (BICC). Less than 100 people witnessed the event. Dumisani Sebata connected with the crowd spiritually as some were spotted crying as he performed. The queen of gospel music, Tholakele, clearly showed she was born to rock the stage as fans joined her in dance. They sang along to tracks off her new album showing that it has been well received in the mining town. To sum up the performances of the day, Knowledge Nkiwane – who is based in South Africa – rocked the crowd and left them clamouring for more with his antics. — @mthabisi_mthire.
