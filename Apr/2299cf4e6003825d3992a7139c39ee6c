Reuben Pembedza Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent FOUNDING member of one of Zimbabwe’s most prominent ensembles, Hloseni Arts, Reuben Pembedza, has died. He was 50. Pembedza passed away on Sunday afternoon after a short illness. One of the founding members of the group, Taurai Moyo, said he was devastated. “I’m heartbroken because I’ve not only lost a friend, but a brother. We formed the group together some 21 years ago and he died exactly on the day we sat down and founded Hloseni Arts (formerly Black Temple Arts) with Talent Ngwenya. “Our first meeting was on the 15th of April in 1997 and I’m pained that he couldn’t wait for the birthday of Hloseni as the group is celebrating its 21st anniversary this month,” Moyo, who is the director of the Zimbabwe International School’s Arts Festival Trust, said. “However, he played his part and those who have remained behind will continue with his legacy. He’ll greatly be missed.” On Pembedza’s character, Moyo said: “He was a person who loved the arts and mainly focused on his organisation. He wanted everything to go well, at the same time, perfect the group’s artistry and teach new members. Such was the character of Rueben.” Mourners are gathered at Number 4 Armagh Road, Queens Park East, Bulawayo.
