Amanda Ruvimbo Nyahwa Nyaradzo Bakari, Chronicle Reporter A FAMILY from Bulawayo’s Mzilikazi suburb is appealing for more donations amounting to $10 000 as doctors have said funds raised for their daughter who is already in India for a heart surgery are inadequate. Amanda Ruvimbo Nyahwa (11), a Grade Four pupil at Mzilikazi Primary School, is in India after her parents raised $15 000 for the operation. While in India, Amanda’s mother Mrs Naume Nyahwa was told that there was a need to conduct a throat surgery before the heart surgery, hence $10 000 more was required. “They said she has threads that are blocking her throat so they need to operate on it before conducting the heart surgery. We have already paid more than $11 000 for the heart surgery but an extra $10 000 is required for another surgery,” said Mrs Nyahwa, who lives at Sotshangane Flats in Mzilikazi. “The doctors said they will be able to conduct both surgeries on Wednesday but lack of money is slowing the process. I appeal to members of the public to help save our daughter’s life. If the surgery is not conducted soon, we may need to top up more money for our return flight because we had booked it for Sunday so there will be extra charges if we postpone.” She said they raised part of the money to go to India through a loan. “The situation is difficult; my husband does not earn much to raise the required amount. Those who wish to help may deposit at Barclays bank Bulawayo Main branch account number 23071150313 or Ecocash 0775 191 461,” said Mrs Nyahwa. @NyarieBakie
