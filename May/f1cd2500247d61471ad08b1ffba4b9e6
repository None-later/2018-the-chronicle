Highlanders welfare manager Vezigama Dlodlo receives part of the Deep Freez Cold Sprays from the Bosso Tshilamoya Chapter representative Fisnoliah Nolie Dube at the club offices on Monday Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter A HIGHLANDERS social media supporters group has donated nine Deep Freez Cold sprays to the club for treatment of players. The sprays were presented to the team’s welfare manager Vezigama Dlodlo by Bosso Tshilamoya Chapter representative Fisnoliah Nolie Dube at the club offices on Monday. “We love our club and know that it has a lot of obligations and therefore cannot meet everything that players might want, so we thought of assisting in our small way as a WhatsApp supporters group,” said  Dube. She said they had resolved to continuously supply the club with the sprays, particularly at a time Madinda Ndlovu’s boys are being hit by multiple injuries in every match. “It’s our wish as Bosso Tshilamoya Chapter that the club stops worrying about buying these cold sprays anymore,” said Dube. A Deep Freeze Cold Spray delivers an instant burst of cooling pain relief and helps relieve painful sprains, strains, muscle pain and pain associated with arthritis and backache. They promote cooling therapy for muscles and joints. Highlanders’ chief executive officer Nhlanhla Dube thanked the supporters’ chapter for their gesture. “We appreciate what they have done and wish to extend our warm thank you to them. “There is no donation too big or too small at Highlanders and if fans go out of their way and give to the club, such a donation is really appreciated,” he said.
