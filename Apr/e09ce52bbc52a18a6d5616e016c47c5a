Showbiz Reporter AN unidentified man was pepper sprayed and beaten up by another man for grabbing the buttocks of the latterâ€™s female companion during the oversubscribed Jah Prayzah show at Hartsfield Tshisanyama on Saturday night. This happened in the VIP section right next to the stage while Jah Prayzah was performing. As the show was going along smoothly, a fight broke out after two heavily built men started pushing and shoving each other. Thereafter, one of them pulled out a can of pepper spray and applied it generously on his opponent. The vapour quickly spread around and forced people to vacate the epicentre as the fumes started choking them and causing them to cough. This however, did not affect the show as Jah Prayzah was unharmed and security caught up with the culprits. After a while, people went back to their positions but with caution.
