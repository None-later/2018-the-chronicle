 Sukoluhle Ndlovu, Midlands Correspondent A POLICE officer has been arraigned for possession of four twists of marijuana. Constable Prince Chiwawa (28) who is based at Nkayi Police Station was busted after he refused to pay bus fare, saying he was a police officer. Officers following up on the report found the drug in one of his bags. He pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of dangerous drugs when he appeared before Zvishavane Magistrate Mr Shepherd Munjanja. In mitigation, Cst Chiwawa told the court that he smoked mbanje to relieve anxiety and stress caused by dealing with lots of criminals. Magistrate Munjanja castigated him for his wayward behaviour, saying he should be an example to society. He was fined $100 for possession of drugs and another $100 for making off without payment. In addition to that, Magistrate Munjanja slapped Chiwawa with a three month prison term which was wholly suspended on condition that he does not commit a similar crime within the next five years. The agreed facts are that on May 30, Constable Chiwawa, who was aboard a Masvingo-bound bus from Bulawayo, refused to pay bus fare saying he was a police officer. The conductor of the bus, Mr Omega Pedzi, asked Chiwawa to produce a police identity card but he failed to do so. Upon arrival in Zvishavane, the bus crew reported Chiwawa at Zvishavane Police Station and he was taken in for questioning. His bag was also searched and four twists of mbanje were found. The marijuana was confiscated for exhibit purposes and he was immediately arrested. Mr Talent Tadenyika prosecuted.
