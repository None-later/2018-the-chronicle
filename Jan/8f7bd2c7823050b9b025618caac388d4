 Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter PUGILIST Elvis Moyo will use his Friday World Boxing Federation Africa heavyweight title defence fight against Congolese Kilola Lubika Knife Didier as part of his preparations for a European bout. Moyo, known as Bulawayo Bomber, will trade leather with Knife Didier in a bill dubbed “New Dawn” at Harare’s City Sports Centre on Friday night. Moyo told Chronicle Sport that the organisers of the Friday fight, Kalakoda Promotions, have secured him a non-title fight against Croatian boxer Ivica Perkovic on March 16 in Vienna, Austria. “Things are looking good and I’m ready for the Friday fight against Didier. I’m also grateful to my promoters Kalakoda Promotions who’ve secured another fight for me in March. I’ll fight in the Europe versus Africa competition, where Kalakoda Promotions will take along five boxers from Africa to square off against Europeans,” said Moyo. The Zimbabwean boxer missed out on the last leg of the Europe versus Africa held in Manchester, United Kingdom, in November last year when his opponents chickened out at the last minute. Perkovic has 56 career fights and has a record of W22; L34:D0. “I saw Perkovic’s record on boxrec.com and I don’t think he is a man who can chicken out at the last minute. In as much as I’m excited by the possibility of a European fight, my focus is on the Didier fight. I want to give Zimbabweans a great fight and show the world what I’m made of,” Moyo said. His fight against Didier will be broadcast live across the continent on Kwese Sport. @ZililoR
