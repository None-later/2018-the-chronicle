Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter REGINA Mundi High School in Lupane district will play host to this year’s Matabeleland North Girls Under-18 Provincial Cricket Finals while Nkayi High will be the venue for the boys’ version of the competition. According to the Matabeleland North Provincial Head in Charge of Cricket,  Fiona Ndlovu, the girls’ event will take place on May 17-18 while the Nkayi event will be held from August 2-3. “For the girls, district competitions ought to be held by next week from May 10-11 and we expect each district to choose its own venue while June 28-29 has been reserved for the district finals for the boys where we again expect the same arrangement in terms of venue,” said Ndlovu, who is the headmistress of Gebhuza High School in Hwange. St James High School are the defending girls provincial champions while Mosi oa Tunya High School ruled the roosts in the boys’ competition last year and the two schools will be eager to hold on to their crowns although they must expect stiff competition from emerging powerhouse, Nemane High School from rural Tsholotsho as well as Somvubu and Inyathi High Schools from Bubi district. Somvubu High School is slowly emerging as a school of sporting excellence in the province and credit must be given to their headmaster Khumbulani Sibanda who is hands on and supportive. “We are still consulting on the venue for our district finals but we expect Inyathi and Somvubu High Schools to do well there,” said the Bubi district head in charge of cricket, Cain Ncube. After the provincial finals Ndlovu said, winners in both categories will head to Hermann Gmeiner Primary School in Bindura, Mashonaland Central province  for the national finals. “Those who will win at Regina Mundi will proceed to the finals at the end of this month while from Nkayi, their finals will be held in September at the same venue,” said Ndlovu.
