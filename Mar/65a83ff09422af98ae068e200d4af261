Bry Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter UP-AND-COMING Gwanda reggae artiste, Bry, has featured Zimdancehall artiste Ras Caleb on a single titled Love Fights that will likely serve as a breakthrough for his music career. The track that details the troubles of relationships has an incredible sound. It was produced by Nesty Bee from the Chee Ghetto Empire Studios. Born Bright Moyo, the gifted artiste is one of a few Gwanda musicians who have ventured into reggae despite the fact that the genre is not popular in the Matabeleland region. The absence of a radio station in the province has also been an obstacle for the musicians to thrive, and Bry believes a radio station should be opened. “There are a lot of talented artistes in Gwanda and around the province. The challenge is that we’ve nowhere to play our music. If a radio station is set up in the province, this will be of great help as we’ll have a platform to showcase our talent and shine thereby helping us to grow,” Bry said. The 20-year-old musician, who is based in Gwanda where he sells motor spare parts as a part time job, said despite having performed at notable events that have been held in his province, he is still failing to make a breakthrough in the music industry. “I’ve tried to make a breakthrough in the industry as I’ve performed at BBQ Gardens in Gwanda, Jabula Inn in Esigodini, Gwanda Government Secondary School, Matabeleland South Agricultural Show Society, Gwanda District Club and at Pelandaba Stadium during the Independence, Defence Forces and Heroes’ Day celebrations, but still, I haven’t made a name for myself.” @mthabisi_mthire
