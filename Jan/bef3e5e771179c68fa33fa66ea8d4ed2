 Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls THE Chess Association of Matabeleland North (CAMN) is leaving no stone unturned in its ambitious plan to take the game to rural communities. Chess is largely viewed as a discipline for urbanites, resulting in most rural schools shunning the game. Kripo Chivhenge, a CAMN organiser, said they had organised a tournament at Mabhikwa High School in Lupane for learners and members of the community. He said they expect between 60 and 100 players and participation fees had been pegged at $3 per player for adults, while secondary and primary school pupils will each pay $2 and $1 respectively. Chivhenge said this would be their first step in venturing into rural areas, with the hope of covering the whole province. “We are trying to remove the myth that chess is for the elite and urban communities and showing people that it’s only a game of the mind, which can also be used as entertainment in schools and communities. We want to promote chess in rural schools so that they match their urban counterparts,” said Chivhenge. There will be prizes for the top three winners in each category. He appealed to individuals and businesses for financial assistance, saying they relied on registration fees for their tournaments. This will be the sixth tournament staged by CAMN since reviving structures last year, with all previous five events being held in Victoria Falls and Hwange. In July last year, 89 participants took part in the VP Joshua Nkomo Memorial Tournament held in Victoria Falls, while 44 participated in the end of year provincial championship in Hwange in December. — @ncubeleon
