 Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent The Old Mutual Heath Streak Academy will this week launch a winter T20 cricket tournament comprising six teams with players drawn from Bulawayo’s first league and Tuskers’ squads. Badgers, Blazers, Raptors, Tigers, Hawks and Sabers will take part in the tournament sponsored by Bonsa Spar. The games will start on July 1 to August 26 with three games. One of the organisers Duncan Frost said the tournament was aimed at giving players game time. “Since the Logan Cup and local league are over, the players will be idle, so we thought of getting them to play and get some valuable game time through this tournament,” said Frost. He said the launch will be held at the academy on Friday where the teams will be handed their playing shirts.
