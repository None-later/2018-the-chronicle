All is set for the Kalawa Homecoming Party Club Version (Homecoming Lite) taking place at Club Cosmopolitan tonight with the headline acts from South Africa, Busiswa, DJs Zinhle and Bobstar expected in the city this afternoon. This subdued event will be replacing the Kalawa Homecoming party which could not be held on a large scale this year due to the economic challenges the country is facing. One of the organisers of the show, Vusumuzi Siqalaba said “All is set for the Kalawa Homecoming Club Version Party. The artists will arrive on Thursday afternoon and the ticket sales are going on smoothly.” Entrance fee to the event has been pegged in rand only with the general fee being R200 and VIP tickets going for R400 before midnight. He said local DJs Liz and Sibago will join the SA crew on the decks. DJ Liz said she was excited to be performing alongside DJ Zinhle, a DJ whom she has become acquainted to after having interacted closely with her at various shows in the city over the years. “I’m so excited to be performing with Zinhle who I last performed with at the Kalawa Homecoming Party last year. I don’t really feel pressured performing alongside her as she’s my role model whom I look up to. “I can’t wait for the show as I’ve prepared a great playlist which I hope the crowd will love.” Liz who thrilled patrons during the Castle Lite party last weekend, has a very tight schedule this festive season as she is also scheduled to play at BAC tomorrow as well as at The Vista street bash taking place on New Year’s Eve.
