Massimiliano Allegri Real Madrid stepped up attempts to fill their vacant manager position as club president Florentino Perez “rang Massimiliano Allegri to offer him the job”. The Juventus manager has been admired by officials in Madrid for a number of years and he sits high up a shortlist drawn up to replace Zinedine Zidane. Italian newspaper Tuttosport revealed that Allegri was contacted by Perez on Friday with suggestions that Zidane could head to Turin if Allegri opts to leave for Spain. Allegri has been in charge of the Old Lady since 2014 and has enjoyed success both domestically and in Europe — leading the club to two Champions League finals. Those ended in defeat to Barcelona and then Real Madrid but he has carved out a reputation as one of the game’s finest managers. The Italian remains under contract in Turin until 2020 and with Madrid’s pressing need to have a new manager in place, Los Blancos would need to pay upwards of £12 million to secure him from his contract. Tuttosport suggest that Juventus are more likely to push for a move at the end of next season — allowing Zidane to take 12 months as a sabbatical. Zidane would be a popular appointment should Allegri depart having represented the Italian side during his illustrious playing career. With the World Cup to commence in nine days, Madrid want a new manager in place as soon as possible and have been cited as holding interest in Mauricio Pochettino, Joachim Low and 30-year-old Hoffenheim manager, Julian Nagelsmann. — SportsMail
