 Nyaradzo Bakari, Chronicle Reporter A POLICE officer stationed in Fairbridge has been served with a garnishee order after his ex-wife dragged him to court demanding $100 for the upkeep of their three year old daughter. Wedzerai Maninji appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Collen Chiruma, who issued a $65 garnishee order. “I know some people who have failed to pay maintenance and are in arrears so I think it will be best to issue a garnishee order so that you do not have to be arrested for contempt of court after having failed to pay maintenance,” said the magistrate. Initially Maninji’s ex-wife, Ms Samantha Mupemhi was demanding $100 from him for the maintenance of their daughter, but after brief negotiations they agreed on $60 and the magistrate added $5. Ms Mupemhi told the court that she was no longer staying with Maninji so the expenses were burdening her. She said Maninji had not been supporting the child for an unspecified period of time. The court heard that the couple separated last month. Maninji said he was failing to support the child because he had another child.—@NyarieBakie.
