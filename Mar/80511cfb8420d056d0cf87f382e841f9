Lovemore Zigara in Gweru AIRMEN Chapungu play their first home game in the Castle Lager premiership when they entertain Harare City at Ascot Stadium this afternoon. “Waru Waru” who lost their opening match to Bulawayo City 0-2 before collecting maximum points in a 3-2 win over Mutare City want to build on the momentum from their last encounter. Their gaffer, Tendai Chikuni, said they would want to make Ascot Stadium a fortress this season and will be seeking to come out with a positive result. “It is going to be a tough game playing against Harare City because they have quality. However, we are prepared for them and as a club we would want to build on the momentum from where we left against Mutare City,” said Chikuni. “We are playing at home and for us we need to maximise on our home games so that we achieve our objectives at the end of the season. We therefore looking at coming out with a positive result,”  he said. The airmen will be missing the services of defender Charles Mativenga who picked a knock during the game against Mutare City but Chikuni said he has capable replacements. “Of course, Mativenga’s loss is a big blow to us because he is one of the experienced players in the team. However, we have enough depth as there are youngsters who want to prove themselves and this is the opportunity,” added the former FC Platinum and Shabanie Mine coach. Chikuni is likely to keep faith in the youngsters whom he has roped in this season following a rebuilding exercise which began last year. To unlock the Sunshine Boys’ defence, the Chapungu gaffer is likely to rely on his wingers with Ian Nyoni on the left while former FC Platinum player Blessing Sahondo will be operating on the right flank while Allen Tavarwisa will be expected to provide the goals. @lavuzigara1
