 Yemurai Ushamba, Chronicle Reporter A BULAWAYO man has been fined $100 after admitting that he fondled a woman’s buttocks but blamed his behaviour on two scuds he had downed. A court heard that Onesome Mlambo (42), of Emganwini suburb indecently assaulted Sphiwe Mathuthu (31) at Nketa 9 shops last Sunday. Mlambo pleaded guilty to indecent assault charges before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Lungile Ncube. “I committed the offence but I was not in my right state of mind. I was drunk since I had downed two scuds. I have lost my dignity because of this matter and I am asking for forgiveness,” he said. Mr Ncube ordered Mlambo to pay a $100 fine or risk being jailed for 90 days if he defaults. “I considered that you are a first offender and you also have a job to keep. You will pay a $100 fine or 90 days in prison,” he said. Prosecuting, Mr Nathan Marime said on July 22 at around 5PM at McInn butchery at Nketa 9 shops, the accused approached the complainant to buy isitshwala. “After he was served with isitshwala, the accused person fondled the complainant’s buttocks without her consent. When she reprimanded him for what he was doing, Mlambo became violent,” he said. The court heard that the matter was reported to the police leading to Mlambo’s arrest. @YUshamba
